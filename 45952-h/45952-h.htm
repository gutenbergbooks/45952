<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The substance of this book was originally delivered as
a Course of Lectures to a week-night congregation. The
Lecture form has been retained, and this accounts for
the repetition of the leading ideas, while the practical
interests of Church life account for the insistence on the
religious value and lesson. It is hoped that this, which
might be irritating to the professional student, may be
helpful to the ordinary reader who is repelled by the
technicality of critical works, and often fails to discern
the devout spirit by which such works are inspired, or to
discover what religious interest is served by them.</p>

<p>Where everything is borrowed from other writers, and
no claim to originality is made, detailed acknowledgment
would be impossible, but the resolve to attempt some
such course in place of the usual form of a week-night
service was formed in the Hebrew class-room of Westminster
College, Cambridge, while listening to the
Lectures on Old Testament Theology and Messianic
Prophecy, delivered by the Rev. Professor Dr. Skinner
(now Principal), in which accurate scholarship was combined
with a deep insight into the present religious
importance of these subjects. Grateful acknowledgment
is also due to the Rev. J.R. Coates, B.A., who kindly read
through the proofs and made many valuable suggestions.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that within
the last few decades a tremendous change has come
over our estimate of the value of the Old Testament,
and that this change is of the gravest importance for
our understanding of religion. But what the exact
nature of the change is, and what we are to deduce
from it, is a matter of debate, for the facts are only
known to professional students and to a few others
who may have been led to interest themselves in the
subject. With some, for instance, the idea prevails
that the Old Testament has been so discredited by
modern research that its religious significance is now
practically worthless. Others believe that the results
arrived at are untrue, and regard them as the outcome
of wicked attacks made upon the veracity of the
Word of God by men whose scholarship is a cloak for
their sinister designs or a mask of their incapacity
to comprehend its spiritual message. There is perhaps
a middle course open to some who have found
a message of God to their souls in the Old Testament,
and who, on hearing that the authorship of this book
has been questioned or the historicity of that passage
assailed, are unmoved, because they believe that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
does not matter who wrote the Pentateuch or the
Psalms so long as through these documents they
hear the voice of the living Word of God. Here
then is a subject on which there exists a distressing
confusion, and, moreover, a subject in which ignorance
plays no small part. Save with a few devout souls who
have made a long and continuous study of the Scriptures,
it may be doubted whether there is any widespread
knowledge of the actual message of the Old
Testament, even among Christian people. There
are certainly many people willing to defend the
authority of the Bible who spend very little time in
reading it. The favourite Psalms and the evangelical
passages of Isaiah are probably well known, and
beyond this there is but the knowledge gained in
early days, from which stand out in the memory
the personalities of Samson and Saul, David and
Goliath, and Daniel in the lion's den, together with
the impressive stories of the Flood, the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah, the crossing of the Red
Sea, and the fall of Jericho. A very little is probably
carried away from the public reading of the Scriptures
in places of worship. It cannot be said that this
acquaintance conveys any real impression of the
magnificent message that lies embedded in these
thirty-nine books which go to make up the Old
Testament. Now whatever harm may be charged to
the modern methods, it can at least be claimed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
neglected portions have been carefully studied, the
meaning of obscure passages discovered, and much
of importance and interest brought to light; but
more than this, it has been discovered that the
essential message of the Old Testament lies largely
apart from those narratives and personalities that
impress the superficial reader, and rather in the
record of a gradual development of the conception of
God and of His purpose in calling Israel to be the
recipient of His self-disclosure. It has been found
that the striking figures of the landscape are of less
importance than the road that winds among them
along which revelation moves to its final goal.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the new inspiration, which
so many who have studied the Scriptures by these
methods claim to have felt, throws quite a new
emphasis on our conception of the Old Testament
and is revolutionary of all that we have been accustomed
to believe concerning it; that the methods
are such as could not legitimately be applied to the
Word of God, and are the products of a criticism
which is puffed up with a sense of its own superiority;
and that the results are discreditable to the Old
Testament, since they allege that some of the narratives
are unhistorical, some passages and even whole books
unauthentic, and traditions on which the gravest
issues have been staked shown to have nothing more
than a legendary basis. There is much in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
objections that is natural, but much that is misunderstanding.
It is true that the contribution which the
Old Testament makes to religion is estimated differently
from what it was fifty years ago, and it must be
allowed that this brings a charge of having misunderstood
the Scriptures against generations of scholars
and saints. But it is admitted that all matters of
knowledge are open to misunderstanding. It is no
argument against the conception that the earth moves
round the sun, that the contrary idea was held in
other ages. We know that the understanding of the
Old Testament has been obscured, often by those
who ought to have been the greatest authorities on
its meaning. Jesus read into the Scriptures a meaning
unrecognised by the authorities of His day, and
dealt with them in a fashion that was regarded as
revolutionary. To some of the Scriptures He appealed
as to a final authority, but others He regarded as
imperfect and only suited to the time in which they
were written. The Jews of His day venerated every
letter of the sacred writings, and regarded the very
copies of the Law as sacred to the touch, and yet on
their understanding of the Scriptures they rejected
the mission and message of Jesus. Christian scholarship
has undoubtedly followed rather after the Rabbis
than after Christ. The message of the Old Testament
that the new methods have made clear
certainly appears to be more in conformity with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
Spirit of Christ than with that of His opponents, and if
this is revolutionary then it is no new thing; religion
always moves along such lines.</p>

<p>Great offence has been caused and insuperable
prejudice aroused among many by the name under
which these methods have become known. The
name, "higher criticism," conveys to most people a
suggestion of carping fault-finding and an assumption
of superiority. This is due to an entire misunderstanding
of a technical term. Criticism is
nothing more than the exercise of the faculty of
judgment, and, moreover, judgment that ought to
be perfectly fair. The sinister suggestion that is
conveyed in the word is due to the fact that our
criticisms are so often biassed by personal prejudices.
But this only condemns our faults, and not the
method. "Higher" criticism does not mean any
assumption of superiority, but is simply a term
used to distinguish it from "lower" criticism. The
criticism that endeavours to ascertain the original
text by a comparison of the various documents
available is called <i>lower</i>, and that which deals
with matters higher up the stream of descent by
which the writings have been conveyed to us, namely,
matters of date and authorship, is called <i>higher</i>
criticism. It might well be called literary and historical
criticism, in distinction from textual criticism.
It employs historical methods, and uses the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
tests of comparison and contemporaneity. For the
understanding of a particular age, it prefers those
documents that describe the times in which they
were written, and give indirect evidence, rather than
those histories which were written long after the event
and which reveal a purpose other than the strictly
historical. Fortunately, we have in the Old Testament
many such contemporary and indirect witnesses
in the writings of the Prophets. They are
not consciously writing history, but they tell us
indirectly what the practices of their day were, and
especially what religious ideas were prevalent; for
it is these things that they feel called upon to attack.
With these reliable standards we can compare the
regular histories, which were necessarily written at a
much later age, and very often to serve some religious
purpose.</p>

<p>Now it is this method, which is surely a true and
proper one, that has changed our estimate of the
history and development of religion in Israel. Are
we to condemn the method without examination
because it destroys certain traditions about the Bible
which we have received largely from Judaism?&mdash;the
Judaism which could find no place for Jesus!
But it will be answered that these methods yield
results that are incompatible with the inspiration of
the Bible, and are unworthy of God's revelation to
us. But how are we to decide what is compatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
with inspiration? We can only tell, surely, by
seeing what these results are and by discovering
whether they bring any inspiration to us. Can we
be certain, without examining the facts, to what lines
the revelation of God is to be restricted? Is this
not coming to the Bible with a theory which we
have manufactured and which will surely distort the
facts? It will be said that anything less than absolute
accuracy makes void any claim to be a Divine
revelation. Let us consider what this means. We
know that the historical spirit, which endeavours
to see history as it actually happened quite apart
from our desires or sympathies, is an ideal which
has only emerged with the general spread of education,
and that in ancient times history was written
largely with a view to edification, and especially for
giving such lessons as would lead to right principles
being adopted for the future. It was not the accuracy
of the material but suitability for its purpose that
weighed with the historian. Now, with these conditions
existing, was it impossible for God to speak
to men through their conceptions of history, or had
He to wait until the historical spirit prevailed?
Could He not use the early legends which they
believed, and through them bring the truth to men?
We know that the greatest of all religious teachers
did not scruple to embody the highest truths in
such parables as lowly minds could receive. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
may demand that revelation shall be infallible, but
this would need in turn an infallible person to receive
it, and even then an infallible interpreter. An infallible
revelation would mean that there could never
be any progress in revelation; that it would have to
be given perfect in one process; that it would have
to be authenticated to men by authority, since it
would be beyond the understanding of a fallible mind;
that it would break in upon every other experience,
remain isolated, and never be grasped by that strong
conviction which we call faith; and this would entail
a destruction of the mental faculties of man, and an
acknowledgment that communication between God
and man is really impossible. Could not God speak
to man in his infancy, and with the growing understanding
would there not be growing light?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, whatever we feel about these abstract
principles, we ought to know the facts. In the pages
that follow an endeavour is made to present the
results at which a consensus of opinion has arrived.
There will be no great time spent in argument for or
against these facts. Such are to be sought in the
scientific works and in the dictionaries, which alone
can deal adequately with these facts, but since many
altogether refuse to consider the facts because of
the inferences which they think can be drawn from
them, this book is an earnest plea for earnest men to
consider whether it is not open to be shown that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
from these facts there comes to us a much clearer
understanding of God's ways with man; a more
certain conviction that in the past God has actually
spoken through the Scriptures; a clue to a better
understanding of the place Jesus occupies in the
history of revelation; and what we all need greatly
to-day: a preparation of heart that we may follow
the leading of that Spirit who ever has and who ever
will guide into all truth those who are willing to
follow Him. The aim of this book is that the reader
may feel that the voice which speaks in his own
heart and the voice which has guided man through
all his strange history is One, and is of God.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Read, as Introduction to this Lecture, the Tenth Chapter of Genesis.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most interesting documents in anthropology. It is
an attempt at a scientific ethnology, and seems to have been expanded
from the closing verses of the preceding chapter. It will be noticed
that those verses are in poetical form (R.V.), and are likely to be very
ancient.</p>

<p>Note the principles of classification:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Geographical. It is a very incomplete summary of the peoples of
the earth. Only those nations are mentioned that fill the horizon of
the writer's knowledge. That horizon will be found to correspond
very largely with that of the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel.</p>

<p>(2) Prejudice. The evident kinship of some peoples is denied on the
ground of dislike; for the same reason, Moab and Ammon, who are
well known, are simply omitted.</p>

<p>The real test of kinship is language, which is here ignored.</p>

<p>The names are not to be taken as individuals. Of this the very form
is witness: Ludim is plural, Mizraim is dual, Tarshish is the name of
a place, and Amorite is gentilic.</p>

<p>Notes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hang18">

<p>Verse 2. Madai = Medes. Javan = the Greeks, or more particularly,
the Ionians.</p>

<p>Verse 4. Tarshish is probably Spain. Kittim = the Cretans.
Dodanim (read Rodanim 1 Ch. i. 7) = the inhabitants
of Rhodes.</p>

<p>Verse 6. Mizraim: the name for Egypt. Canaan: here and
elsewhere said to be descended from Ham. Beyond
all doubt the Canaanites were a Semitic people and
spoke a language akin to Hebrew. Religious antagonism
and the fact of their conquest demanded in the
popular imagination a different ancestry.</p>

<p>Verse 14. "Whence went forth the Philistines" is misplaced, and
should follow after "Caphtorim" (Amos ix. 7).</p>

<p>Verse 21. Eber: the name of the supposed ancestor of the
Hebrews.</p>

<p>Verse 22. Elam = Persia. Racially the Elamites were quite distinct
from the Semites. This inclusion may be a
clue to the date of this Table of Nations; friendship
with Persia dates from Cyrus (Sixth Century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>).</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SEMITIC RACES</span></h3>

<p>The Hebrew nation forms a branch of that group
of the human family known as the Semites. Their
relation to the other great racial divisions of mankind
is far beyond the reach of our enquiry, and we
cannot even penetrate to a period when the Semites
formed an unbroken family. At the remotest date
to which history can take us we find the family
already widely dispersed, with distinct national
characteristics well developed, and their common
ancestry quite forgotten in their violent hatreds of
their unrecognised kinsmen. Indeed it is only the
test of language which still preserves for us an
indisputable proof of their common origin. Their
existence can be traced back to a very remote date,
for fragments of their literature and other evidences
of civilisation have been discovered that have been
dated 5000&ndash;4000 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and even at that period the
language shows signs of phonetic degeneration that
require a still further period for the process to have
reached this stage.</p>

<p>The primitive home of the Semites cannot have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
been, however, where these ancient remains have
been found, namely, in the Euphrates valley, for
the records themselves show that they were only
immigrants there and had replaced the original
inhabitants, who came of Sumerian stock. Neither
was it in Palestine, as our own Bible will tell us;
but it is probably to be sought in Arabia, where the
purest Semitic stock is still to be found. In this
desert home the race was bred that was destined
to have such a tremendous influence on the history
of the world, and it is largely to this desert training
that we can trace influences which have made them
what they are. The battle for life in that inhospitable
land would mould a physique capable of extraordinary
endurance, and to this we can perhaps trace the
virility of the modern Jew, who has resisted for
centuries the poisonous ghettos of European cities
and remains far healthier than his indigenous
neighbours. This hard training fitted them for an
exacting life, and in the Phœnicians they became
the traders of antiquity, and in the Carthaginians
and Saracens, warriors not to be despised. Hardness
easily becomes cruelty, and purely Semitic
empires, such as Assyria, developed a barbarous
cruelty, the story of which is told on their inscriptions
and in the denunciations of the Hebrew
Prophets. There is something in the Semitic
character that is disliked by Western nations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the Jews have been subjects of relentless persecution
in mediæval times, and are still capable of arousing
bitter hostility, as may be seen from those violent
eruptions of anti-Semitism which occasionally burst
through the cosmopolitanism of Western Europe.
The well-defined limitations of their primitive home&mdash;crushed
in between the continents of Europe, Africa
and Asia, the neutral ground of the Eastern and
Western worlds&mdash;seem almost to be reflected in the
limitations of their mental development. The Semitic
tongue is crude in its simplicity and incapable of
expressing an abstract idea, and it is natural to find
as a result that the philosophical faculty is almost
entirely missing. Although they have given to the
world an alphabet, a system of numeration which
has made mathematics possible, and the beginnings
of measurement and of the science of astronomy, yet
their mind is not scientific in the modern sense.
They possess, as perhaps no other race, the gift of
telling stories of wonder and mystery, and for a
simple tale of love and pathos they are unsurpassed.
They have produced the finest lyrical literature of
the ancient world, but have contributed hardly anything
to dramatic or epic poetry, and their achievements
in art have been cramped by their religious
prejudices.</p>

<p>But in the realm of religion they are supreme, and
have become the high-priests of humanity, for from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
them have gone forth three great religions, and one
of these capable of development into the universal
religion of mankind. These faiths have not been
slowly evolved from the national consciousness, but
have both sprung from and been embodied in inspiring
personalities; for have they not given to the world
Moses and the Prophets, Mahomet, and the Son of
Man?</p>

<p>The Semites are divided by anthropologists into
the following groups: Southern Group&mdash;North
Arabians, Sabæans, Abyssinians; Northern Group&mdash;Babylonians,
Assyrians, Aramæans, Canaanites,
Hebrews; and all these groups seem to have been
formed from the original stock by migrations from
their home in Arabia. The contracted area of the
Arabian peninsula, the inability of the land to support
a large population, coupled with their restless spirit
and the constant feuds between the tribes, made
emigration a necessity at a very early period. The
exact history and order of these migrations it is now
impossible to trace, but it would seem that the first
great movement was eastward, whither they were
drawn by the culture and wealth of the Sumerian
civilisation in the Euphrates valley. It is quite
possible that this movement commenced 6000 years
before Christ. At a later date they seem to have
invaded Egypt and left some traces upon the language
and customs of that land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
The land of Syria would offer a near and easy
home for the emigrants, and yet the first Semites to
arrive in Palestine seem to have come from the
Euphrates. The inhabitants they displaced were the
Hittites, who probably came from Asia Minor; they
were Turanians, and were akin to the present
inhabitants of Armenia. It is only lately that excavation
has revealed the remains of a Hittite Empire
in Palestine. The first Semitic tribes to reach
Palestine pushed down to the seaboard, where they
developed a wonderful maritime civilisation and
became the daring traders and explorers who are
known in history as the Phœnicians; the other
tribes occupied the hill country and became the
Canaanites of Bible story. Of the next migration
westward, the Bible preserves a popular account in
the story of the journey of Abraham from Ur of the
Chaldees. Now Abraham and his descendants were
called Hebrews, and this name is traced to an
ancestor who was called Eber or Heber. It is
doubtful whether an <i>individual</i> so named ever existed.
The name "Hebrew" means "one from the other
side," and would therefore have been a suitable name
for those who crossed the Euphrates, coming from
Arabia; but of this movement the Bible knows
nothing. Some have supposed that the name
was given much later to the tribes who entered
Palestine across the Jordan. The discovery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Tel-el-Amarna tablets has somewhat complicated our
understanding of these events. These tablets were
letters written by the vassal-kings of Syria to their
overlord Amenophis III., King of Egypt, and in them
the King of Jerusalem calls for help against some
tribes who are invading the country and whom he
names <i>Habiri</i>. Now the date of this correspondence
is about 1500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and if these are the Hebrews, we
shall have to suppose that not all the tribes of Israel
went down into Egypt or that the Exodus took place
some two centuries earlier than the date given in the
Bible; but the whole question of the identification
of the Habiri is not yet certain.</p>

<p>It is, however, with those Hebrew tribes who were
afterwards known as the children of Israel that we
have to do; and however remote, and by whatever
stages it is to be traced, their Semitic relationship is
certain. Their own tradition of the birthplace of
Abraham shows that they are conscious of their
common origin with the Babylonians; the stories in
Genesis acknowledge their kinship with Moab and
Ammon, even though national hatred has coloured
the account of their birth (Gen. xix. 30&ndash;38). They
formed a brotherly covenant with Edom, and Ishmael
is recognised not only to be kin but to be the elder.
The Canaanites were disowned wrongly, for they
were certainly Semites; but the Philistines rightly,
for they came into Palestine over-sea from Crete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
We need always to bear in mind that our Bible is
the product of Semitic thought, and whatever its
universal message, it is expressed in the forms of
Semitic genius; and yet that the Hebrews stand
out from the other Semitic nations is indisputable,
and the distinguishing mark is the purity of their
religion. What is the cause of that difference?
How came such a tender root out of such a dry
ground?</p>

<p>Renan is responsible for the popular idea that the
Semites have a natural tendency towards Monotheism.
The idea should present no difficulties for a theory of
Revelation, but it is certainly not true. It is not
true of the general type of Semitic religion, and it
cannot be claimed, in the face of the Prophets' record
of their countrymen's lapses, that it was true even
of the Hebrews. If it were said that there was that
in Semitic history and character which, provided
opportunity were given, would offer a congenial soil
for the reception of monotheistic ideas, it would be
the utmost that could be said. Neither is there more
truth in the antithesis that contrasts the Aryan
conception of God as immanent with the Semitic as
transcendent; for in their primitive stages Aryan and
Semitic religions are alike.</p>

<p>Primitive Semitic religion is indeed quite polytheistic;
every tribe has its own god and this
god is closely identified with a particular locality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Therefore, to be an outcast from the tribe meant to
be an exile from the protection and service of the
god. This idea can be found in the Bible as late as
David, who thought that if he were driven forth from
his own land he would have to serve other gods
(1 Sam. xxvi. 19). The god is conceived to be the
father of the tribe, while the land is the mother, and
this in quite a physical and literal sense. The same
idea is of course frequent in the Greek religions, and
some such conception must be the original of the
strange tradition in Genesis (vi. 1), which describes
a union between the sons of God and the daughters
of men. The connection of the god with the tribe is
therefore simply a matter of blood descent, and the
blood becomes in consequence invested with sacred
virtues. The blood of the tribe cannot be shed by
one of the members without incurring the vengeance
of the god; and the use of the blood of animals in
various ceremonies may point to the belief in a
common ancestry for men and animals; in some
tribes the animal is regarded as a superior being, and
is actually worshipped. The blood of animals even
is thought to be too sacred for human consumption,
and is therefore set apart by libation as suitable food
for the god. Seeing that the connection between the
god and man is only tribal, the shedding of the blood
of any other tribe is quite allowable; for the tribal
god cares only for his own people, and others cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
approach him (2 Kings xvii. 27). It is evident
that a religion based upon such ideas can never be a
factor in the moral development of a people. It only
needs to provide for help against enemies, counsel in
times of national affliction, and oracles for difficult
problems of judgment; therefore, in times of national
prosperity and security, it will play no part beyond
that of custom; and custom often seems the stronger
in proportion to its lack of meaning.</p>

<p>We may insist that the Hebrew religion is superior
to all this because it owes its origin to the special
revelation of God; but even that does not preclude
us from enquiring through what natural causes
this revelation came, if we believe that natural
causes form some part of the working of the Divine
mind.</p>

<p>Now these ideas common to Semitic religion
persisted among the Hebrews and were only shaken
by the earnest ministry of the Prophets, and eventually
destroyed by the reflection which followed the national
disaster of the Exile. The continued national trouble
of Israel was therefore a factor in her advance in the
truth, and she stands as a witness to the possibility
of suffering being an educative force. Moreover, she
found that her Promised Land was only a little strip
hemmed in between the desert and the sea, where
all dreams of world-empire were forbidden. Then
it was that this nation turned her thoughts to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
spiritual kingdom, and looking across the sea that
she feared to cross saw a day when the distant
isles should be her possession, because she had given
to them the Law of Jehovah, and the knowledge
of God.</p>

<h3>THE STRATA OF THE PENTATEUCH</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>We give here for reference the proposed identification of the documents
that critics say can be recognised in the construction of the
first five books of the Bible. The theory has been developed so as to
include the Books of Joshua, Judges, and some parts of Samuel, all of
which are said to bear the same marks of composition from pre-existing
documents.</p>

<p>"J." Jahvistic. Dated 900&ndash;700 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> This document is especially
distinguished for using the name of Jehovah, or "Yahwè," and is
anthropomorphic in its conception of God.</p>

<p>"E." Elohistic. Dated 750&ndash;650 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The name for God in this
document is "Elohim," and its conception of God is more spiritual and
elevated than in "J."</p>

<p>"D." Deuteronomist. Dated 650&ndash;550 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> This document has
the style and thought of the Book of Deuteronomy, where it is chiefly,
though by no means exclusively found. The central idea of this
document is <i>the one sanctuary</i>.</p>

<p>"P." Priestly Code. Dated 550&ndash;400 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> This document supplies
the framework of the Pentateuch, and is distinguished by its interest
in questions of ritual, and by its very legal and stereotyped style.</p>

<p>The dates given above are arrived at from a comparison of the ideas
expressed in these documents with their emergence in the historical
books of the Old Testament. Only for the last two can it be claimed
that there are historical events which are said to confirm them.
These are: the finding of the Book of the Law in the reign of Josiah,
and the promulgation of the Law by Ezra.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE PRIMITIVE RELIGION OF THE
HEBREWS</span></h3>

<p>We have seen from the last lecture that an
examination of the general type of Semitic Religion
gives us no explanation of the mature development of
the Religion of the Hebrews; on the contrary, that
development would seem to take place in spite of the
common Semitic characteristics, for it is against
these characteristics and the natural tendency to
return to them that we find the Prophets continually
at war. If this is so, can we penetrate to the first
stage at which the new religious movement begins
which was to reach such glorious heights in Jeremiah,
the Psalmists and the Son of Man? It is certainly
not to be found in the general character of Semitic
religion; does it commence with the ancestor of the
Hebrew race, the Patriarch Abraham?</p>

<p>To this question the editor of Genesis means
to return a decided answer: the true religion of
Jehovah existed from the earliest times, and all
lower forms are deteriorations from that pure original
revelation. The earliest stories in Genesis are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
to bear witness to this; Abel offered the true
worship of God in that he brought of the best of
his flock, thus agreeing with the sacrifice of animals
set forth in the fully-developed ritual of Leviticus
as the only means of approach to God; Noah
offers of "clean" animals; the Patriarchs offer
animal sacrifices, and call upon the name of Jehovah;
Rebekah goes to enquire of Jehovah and obtains an
oracle. The author means to convey by this that
the earliest religion was the religion which we find
outlined in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with the
exceptions that a priest is not necessary, and that
sacrifice is permitted at other places besides the one
chosen sanctuary. This idea is enshrined in that
favourite name for God which we find in the Old
Testament, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</p>

<p>We have now to enquire whether this is a correct
view of the history, or only the writer's speculations
about an age long removed from his own. We are
moved to do this because there are certain facts in
this history that do not seem to fit in with the
author's view. It is evident at the outset, that the
writer, whoever he be, is dealing with subjects concerning
which he can have at best only second-hand
knowledge. This may have been conveyed to him
in documents, or in popular tradition. If the object
of the compilation of this history was not so much
to produce an accurate and exact history as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
interpret the past as a religious lesson for his own
age, it cannot be instantly dismissed as improbable
that he may have altered some of his material so as
to accord more closely with his own religious views.
Now scholars say that they can detect the presence
of various documents, which have been loosely combined
and coloured with the editor's own ideas of
what should have taken place. There is hardly any
theory which has excited more ridicule from a certain
class of Biblical students. The idea is dismissed offhand
as utterly unworthy of a sacred writer; and
even if he did adopt such a scissors-and-paste
method of compiling history, it is denied that
anyone could detect the various strata now. No
defence of these claims of the critical school need be
attempted here, for we are taking their theories as
granted, with the idea of seeing what their acceptance
as true would mean to our estimate of the Bible and
Revelation; but it may be shown that the Evangelist
Luke is not ashamed to confess that he used something
like this method in compiling his Gospel.
From the Table that faces this lecture, it will be
seen that the critics give dates for these documents
that lie very far apart, and if the dates are even
approximately true, it is a fair conclusion that with
such wide separation of time, and with the consequent
difference both in language and idea, there should be
sufficient criteria to detect the different strata. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
critics who have attempted the disintegration of the
original documents of the Pentateuch have been
challenged to show their fitness for such a task by
extricating the respective contributions in a joint
authorship novel such as "The Chaplain of the Fleet,"
by Walter Besant and James Rice. Or, again, such
claims are discounted on the ground of the known
failures of professional literary critics to recognise
under pseudonym or anonymity, the style of a well-known
author, or even to guess correctly the sex of the
writer. The analogy fails because the circumstances
are entirely different. It would be on more equal
terms to deny that it would be possible to distinguish,
say, the personal opinions of the author of an English
History from the passages quoted from the Doomsday
Book, Chaucer, or an Act of the Long Parliament, if
all quotation marks and references were omitted.</p>

<p>For according to the witness of the very documents
themselves this conception of the early history
must be set aside as not quite correct. The history
in Genesis is conscious that some new start began
with Abraham: he abandoned idolatry. Still more
clearly is it seen that with Moses another epoch
began, for according to one document, the very name
of Jehovah was unknown before its revelation to
Moses (Exod. vi. 2, 3). We are, therefore, faced with
the necessity of enquiring how much of the stories
of the Patriarchs can be called history in any true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
sense. The reasons for and against their historical
value may be summarised:</p>

<p><i>Against</i>: (1) The stories must have been composed
long after the events took place. (2) Tribal
movements and personal incidents seem to have been
confused. (3) The endeavour to explain the origin
of personal and geographical names is often merely
popular, and etymologically incorrect. (Compare
with this the common errors of our own day; for
instance, the explanation of the name of Liverpool
from a supposed bird called the liver, now known to
be entirely mythical.) (4) While the contemporary
history of this period is now quite an enlightened
field, and the life, character, and customs of the
inhabitants of Palestine in this age of the Patriarchs
comparatively well known, we look in vain for any
mention of these persons themselves.</p>

<p><i>For</i>:(1) The narratives of the Patriarchs are
admitted by critics to have been taken from at least
two documents of separate origin and of different
dates. This should double the weight of the evidence.
(2) The simplicity of the narratives in many places
looks like a relation of fact. (But over against this
must be placed the genius for relating a story of pure
fiction which is so peculiar a distinction of the
Semites. Some of the narratives are quite artificial;
as the story of Isaac's lie to shield his wife, which
follows a similar story related of Abraham.) (3) We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
might appeal to the memory of the Bedawin reciters,
who can repeat almost incredibly long portions of
the Koran.</p>

<p>The most likely solution of this conflicting evidence
would seem to be that in the history of the Patriarchs
we have a modicum of historical foundation which has
been worked up into popular and idealised legends.
If the stories of the three Patriarchs be carefully
studied, it will be noticed that while the stories of
Jacob are matter of fact, and do outline a conceivable
character, the stories of Isaac produce only a nebulous
character impression, while Abraham stands forth as
a character which has been idealised. This would be
an accountable psychological process: in the case of
Jacob a good deal of detail is remembered, Isaac is
almost forgotten, while in the case of Abraham, only
the name and a few incidents are known, which
serve to form the framework of a religious lesson.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the conception of their religion
that idealisation has most plainly occurred, for it is
mainly the religion of the Ninth Century, that is, of
the age immediately preceding the great literary
Prophets. In the documents themselves there is left
to the careful reader ample indication in customs and
narratives, the meaning of which has escaped the
notice of the editor, that a more primitive form of
religion prevailed. It would seem, as we have seen,
that the name of Jehovah was unknown to them, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
there are evident tokens of polytheistic belief (Gen.
xxxi. 19; xxxv. 1&ndash;4). The crudity of the worship may
be seen in the frequent reference to the erection of
pillars and stones, which, it will be seen later, have
more than a merely memorial purpose. The ease with
which we find idolatry always reappearing in later
history points to some hereditary tendency at work
among the mass of the people. If, however, we
suppose that the primitive religion was entirely
heathen we shall be faced with the problem of discovering
some necessary point of departure to which
the higher revelation could affix itself. We may
suppose, therefore, that among the ancestors of the
Hebrews there was held a faith that was relatively
purer than that common to the Semites, a faith which
contained in itself the guarantee of the possibility of
advance, if only favourable conditions arose; that
"El, the Mighty One (<i>Shaddai</i>)," was worshipped, but
along with the retention of customs and ideas that
are to be found in some forms of demon worship,
that is, with the recognition of many other great spirits,
not all of whom are thought of as inimical to man;
very much as we find among the North American
Indians the idea of a Great Spirit, existing side by
side with heathen practices and beliefs.</p>

<p>So far our enquiry has not taken us on to very sure
ground, and we must seek other methods. In the
study of Comparative Religion the idea of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
natural order of the evolution of religion predominates,
but the actual origin of religion is still only a matter
of speculation, as indeed it is bound to remain from
the very nature of religion itself, since it is a vision
of faith, rising in different ages and races through
quite different processes. We propose now to take
both the speculations and the assured results of the
study of Comparative Religion, and using these as
tests, see if they have left any traces in the evolution
of the Hebrew religion or if they can guide
us to its possible origins. The principles of such
enquiry and application may be stated.</p>

<p>(1) The ascertained customs and ideas of other
religions, especially those of the Semites, will form
a working hypothesis, and if we then find any
reference to these customs or ideas in the Old
Testament, it will make towards reasonable proof
of a similar origin.</p>

<p>(2) We must be careful, however, to exclude
customs that are known to have been borrowed from
the Canaanites, such as the practice of Baal-worship.</p>

<p>(3) At the same time we must beware of
assuming, without further enquiry, that all the observances
ordained by the religion of Jehovah whose
origins are connected with some historical event are
to be thought of as having their beginning then. It is
more than likely that when a long-established custom
was recognised to be heathen in its origin or tendency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
it would be strictly forbidden, as in the case of the
heathen practice of necromancy; others which had
lost their original meaning would be baptised into a
new significance under the new religion. (With this
phenomenon may be compared our own festival of
Christmas Day, taken over from the Roman Saturnalia,
and our mourning customs, which are survivals
of heathenism, and can only with great difficulty be
made to take on a Christian meaning.) Let us then
examine the supposed origins of heathen religion,
and first of all, that known as Totemism.</p>

<p>Totemism is a custom exceedingly common among
savage tribes, in which some animal is chosen as the
badge, or the name of the tribe, and a blood
covenant formed, when the animal becomes the
"totem" or god of the tribe. Popular instances
may be given in the names of many of the Indian
tribes of North America, or even in the crests and
emblems of our now disrupted clans in Scotland,
which can be traced back to a similar idea. In other
cases the totem may be one of the well-known flora
of the country or some other natural object. The
custom is, of course, seen in the well-known worship
of animals which has continued even among nations
of advanced civilisation. Are there any traces of the
influence of this idea at work in the religion of the
Old Testament? There are one or two tribal names
which are names of animals. Simeon is probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the name of a hybrid between a wolf and a hyæna.
Leah means a wild cow, and Rachel is the Hebrew
name for an ewe. The distinction between clean and
unclean animals might be traced to this influence,
but it does not altogether explain the lists in Lev. xi.
and Deut. xiv.</p>

<p>Another theory of the origin of religion is that
known as Animism. This is the belief in the existence
of spirits,&mdash;a belief prompted by the phenomena of
dreams,&mdash;which usually takes the form of belief in the
activity of the spirits of the recently deceased, an
activity which is sometimes thought to be harmful
and therefore feared. Animism, as a belief in a
spiritual activity behind natural phenomena,
especially those of the fearful type, survives in some
form or other in the highest religions, and was particularly
active in the Hebrew idea that Jehovah
controlled natural forces for the deliverance of His
people and for His own wonderful manifestations.
Animism generally survives among uncivilised peoples
in the practice of ancestor worship, of which there is
no trace among the Hebrews.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the belief in Animism has left some
customs behind it. Especially is this seen in the
mourning customs which are designed to render the
relatives unrecognisable to the departed spirit. This
was effected by sprinkling ashes on the head, going
naked or clothed in sackcloth. Cutting the flesh for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
this purpose is expressly forbidden (Lev. xix. 28).
The ritual uncleanness of one who has come into
contact with a dead body is also a relic of Animism,
as is also the strange idea in Num. xix. 15, which
is intended to guard against the spirit taking up its
abode in a position from which it would be difficult
to dislodge it. The funeral feast is held with the
idea that the dead can still partake, but in this case
friendly feelings rather than fear operate. The
conclusion is that Animism has played its part in
the shaping of Israel's religion, but that the cruder
forms of it were dropped at a very early age.</p>

<p>The religion of savage tribes is generally found
to be polytheistic, and this is supposed to be one
of the earliest stages in the development of religion.
It takes the form of the deification of the forces of
Nature or of striking natural objects, which are worshipped
and generally feared, and is therefore a form
of Animism. If the theories of the critics as to the
composition of the early books of the Bible are
correct, we should expect to find that, if any traces
of Polytheism could be detected, they would be
carefully obliterated from the original documents
by the latest editor. There are indications discernible
which show that this has been done, for
although the worship of other gods is always severely
condemned as the greatest of sins, yet at the same
time we find no clear recognition of the idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
One God until the time of the Prophets. The gods
of the heathen are mentioned as if they were real
beings who are to be feared. The evidence for this
may be objected to in detail, but the accumulation
of facts does press the reader to the unavoidable
conclusion that until the Prophets, the faith of Israel
was Monolatry rather than Monotheism, that is, the
worship of one God rather than the definite belief
that He is the Only God.</p>

<p>The very name for God in the Hebrew language
has a plural form (Elohim), but this is explained by a
grammatical custom by which things of exalted idea
are spoken of in the plural, called by grammarians,
<i>the plural of eminence</i>. The evidence for Polytheism
quoted above from Gen. xxxi. 19; xxxv. 1&ndash;4, might
be referred to the introduction of alien idolatrous
practices; but this can hardly be claimed in the
case of the practice mentioned in Lev. xvii. 7, which
must be a reference to the cult of satyrs, or goat-like
demons which were commonly supposed to inhabit
the desert, to the discouragement of which the
ceremony mentioned in Lev. xvi. 8, 10, 21 ff, would
seem to be directed. This strange figure called
Azazel is not elsewhere described in the Old Testament,
but we learn from the Book of Enoch that
this was the name for the King of the Demons, a
kind of <i>djinn</i> who inhabited the wilderness and
demanded toll of human life. (In agreement with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
has been said before it will be noticed how this practice
has been absorbed in the ritual of the Tabernacle,
but with a different meaning.) Even the First Commandment
does not explicitly deny the existence of
other gods; it merely prohibits their worship by the
Israelites. It may be that this command led to
the full monotheistic belief which we find in men
like Isaiah, but that full conception cannot be fairly
read into the First Commandment. Chemosh, the
god of the Amorites, is mentioned in Judges xi. 24, as
a real being who had given the Amorites the possession
of their land, even as Jehovah had given
Canaan to the Israelites. In the popular imagination
these heathen gods would remain as real beings
probably long after the monotheistic belief had
been held by the more enlightened, being thought
of as demon powers, in much the same way as
the early Christians regarded the gods of Greece
and Rome.</p>

<p>When we turn to the evidence from the
customs of worship that owe their origin to
heathen ideas, the supposition that the early
religion of the Hebrews was hardly distinguishable
from that of the Semitic races finds a full
confirmation.</p>

<p>The most determinative of these ideas is that of
the localisation of the god, who appears only at
certain specified places with which he is inseparably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
connected. The appearance is generally in some
form more or less human, and the site of the manifestation
is either marked for posterity by the
erection of a suitable memorial, in the shape of a
stone or an altar, or else some natural object is taken
to be the actual residence of the god. The god is
therefore connected rather with the land than with
the people, and it is this antagonism of the popular
idea with that of the Prophets, who stand for the
relation between Jehovah and Israel as not territorial
but covenanted, which is the key to the history
of Israel. Apart from this prevalent idea, which is
in itself a sufficient proof, we have the frequent
reference to the sacredness of certain memorials and
objects whose original significance cannot be hidden
from the careful reader. We shall examine first
these objects of reverential regard and then proceed
to notice some of the more outstanding customs
whose origin is heathen.</p>

<p>(a) <i>Sacred Stones.</i> Throughout the Old Testament
we meet with numerous references to stones or circles
that form convenient landmarks or natural <i>rendezvous</i>
for national ceremonies. Adonijah strengthens
his rebellion by a great sacrifice at the stone of
Zoheleth&mdash;"the serpent's stone." The extremely
important part which the serpent plays in all Semitic
religion and mythology, together with the sacrificial
act at this spot, points to its having been the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
site of some idolatrous cult. Many of these sacred
stones may have been the shrines of the Canaanites,
and to some of these the invading religion attached
its own meaning. The circle at Gilgal, which is said
to commemorate the crossing of the Jordan, may
be an example of this, for there is some contradiction
in the account which refers it to a memorial erected
by Joshua for this purpose (compare Josh. iv. 2&ndash;6,
20 ff, with iv. 9), and it is more than likely that the
circle of graven images mentioned in Judges iii. 19
(R.V. margin) is to be identified with it. Among
this class of sacred objects must be mentioned the
obscure <i>Mazzebah</i>, translated in the margin of the
Revised Version, "Obelisk." The use of the Mazzebah
is strictly forbidden in Exod. xxxiv. 13, as one
of the idolatrous customs of the former inhabitants
of the land, but in the Eighth Century the Mazzebah
is reckoned by Hosea as one of the essentials of
Hebrew worship, as if he knew nothing of this
proscription in the Law (Hosea iii. iv.). These
pillars were evidently used to mark the place of
worship, and they are said to have been found at
Shechem, Bethel, Gilgal, Mizpeh, and elsewhere.
From their usage in primitive Semitic religion as
well as from their prohibition in Exodus it can be
seen that they had idolatrous significance, and it is
thought that they were rudely carved to resemble the
likeness of the god. The two pillars placed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the temple, called Jachin and Boaz, are probably
connected with the Mazzebah.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Sacred Trees.</i> The continual reference to these
in the Old Testament shows that they had some
special and sacred significance. Such are the terebinths
of Mamre (Gen. xiii. 18; should be singular
according to the Septuagint), the tamarisk at Beersheba
(Gen. xxi. 33), the palm of Deborah (Judges
iv. 5), and the terebinth in Ophrah (Judges vi. 11).
We can understand how to desert peoples trees
naturally stood for objects of thankful reverence, and
in the popular mind were regarded as the special seat
and haunt of a deity. That they also served for the
purpose of obtaining oracles may be seen from
2 Sam. v. 24; with which may be compared the
practice of oracular decision by the rustling of the
famous oaks of Delphi. With this species of tree-worship
we must compare the use of the Asherah
mentioned as a sacred symbol in Judges vi. 25;
this is expressly forbidden in Exod. xxxiv. 13, Deut.
xvi. 21. It used to be supposed that this was a
wooden symbol of a goddess Asherah, but from the
description in the passage quoted from Deuteronomy,
and from Isa. xvii. 8, it would seem to be a tree-like
post, and is more likely to be a remnant of tree
worship, as our own Maypole may be. It came to
pass that the tree or tree-like pole could therefore
stand beside any altar as the sign of the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the god, and in the pre-Prophetic religion of Israel
this was transferred to a sign of the presence of
Jehovah until the Asherah was forbidden, in that
great attempt to make return to idolatry impossible,
the reform under Josiah.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Sacred Springs.</i> A similar origin may be supposed
for the recognised sacredness of springs.
From the names given to some of these it is evident
that they were regarded as the special seat of Divine
power, natural enough, as in the case of the trees, to
a desert-bred race and to dwellers in a land which
never had too plentiful a supply of water. The
proximity of the spring to an altar or sacred stone
confirms this, as in the case of the stone Zoheleth
near the spring En-rogel, the "spring of the fuller."
The name of "En-Mishpat" (Gen. xiv. 7), "the
spring of judgment," would seem to indicate that
springs were used for the purpose of obtaining oracles,
but by what signs this was effected is not known.
The name of the spring in Gen. xvi. 14, where the
angel appeared to Hagar, is significant in this connection:
"the well of the living one who seeth me."</p>

<p>In the customs of worship, and in all customs to
which there is attached a definite religious significance,
we find analogies in the heathen religions which
show that they must have had a common origin.
Chief among these must be classed the custom of
sacrifice. It is natural, therefore, to find that sacrifice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
which has such an undoubtedly natural explanation
in heathen religions as either the food of the god or a
means of propitiation, is nowhere in the Old Testament
explicitly defined as to its intent and meaning.
The root idea is, however, clearly seen in such customs
as that of the setting forth of the Shewbread, however
much the meaning may have become spiritualised by
a purer idea of the nature of Jehovah, while in
Ezek. xliv. 7, 15, this seems to be quite explicitly
stated. As the conception of Deity was spiritualised,
the idea of material food would doubtless grow too
repugnant to be retained in the bare offering of flesh,
and so we get the burnt-offering, the smoke of which
Jehovah can smell. The blood especially, forms the
correct offering, since being the seat of life, it belongs
altogether to God. On the idea of the sacrifice being
used as a propitiation to the Deity, it follows naturally
that the more costly the victim the more acceptable
it will be, and of all sacrifices the most efficacious
will be that of a human being. The story of Abram
and Isaac in Gen. xxii. is made to serve as a condemnation
of human sacrifices, but the origin of the
story may very well have pointed the other way, as
indeed the first part of the story does; and that the
practice was common may be seen from 2 Kings
xvi. 3; xxi. 6; Jer. vii. 31; xix. 5 (Delete the last
words of Jer. xix. 5, as an evident gloss from vii. 31).
True, in these passages human sacrifice is said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
in express contravention of the will of Jehovah, but
no such comment is added to the story of Jephthah
(Judges xi. 30 ff.), while in Micah vi. 7, the sacrifice of
the firstborn is simply classed among other sacrifices as
part of the common idea. A remnant of this horrible
practice is probably to be found in the consecration
of the firstborn to Jehovah, while the legality of
human sacrifice is determinative in the common
practice of the "ban," by which all captives were
devoted to Jehovah, and any violation visited by the
direst vengeance; as in the case of Saul and Agag.
Another use of the sacrifice was that of ratifying a
covenant by cutting a victim in parts, between which
the contracting parties passed (Gen. xv. 9&ndash;17;
Jer. xxxiv. 18).</p>

<p>Much the same result will be found from enquiry
into the origin of special feasts and customs that
are said to have been instigated at the express command
of Jehovah; for there is evidence which shows
that they were often customs common amongst the
heathen, and were only invested with a new significance
by the higher religion of the Hebrews.
Among these it is likely that we must reckon even
the Passover, for the daubing of the lintels is said to
be a common heathen practice, and it will be noticed
in support of the pre-Mosaic origin of the ceremony
that at its first mention in Exod. xii. 21, it is called
<i>the</i> Passover. The meaning of the Hebrew word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
translated "Passover" is also capable of another
meaning than that given in the story of its institution,
a meaning which also points to its being the survival
of a Semitic and heathen custom. Similar enquiry
into ancient religions of the Semitic type shows that
originally circumcision had no special religious significance,
but was probably a sign of puberty and the
right to marry. As manners softened it became a
family rite and there was no need to postpone it till
years of manhood. The practice of wearing special
garments at religious rites is also found in heathen
religions, and still maintains itself in our habit of
wearing "Sunday clothes."</p>

<p>The results of these enquiries are sufficiently
startling to those who have been accustomed to
regard the religion of Israel as starting from some
definite act of revelation which ordained these ordinances
and their religious meaning for the first time.
But it is common enough in history to find that
customs persist long after their original significance
has been forgotten, and that they are gradually
invested with a meaning more appropriate to the
spirit of the age. We are not, however, shut up to
the conclusion, that, because we can trace much of
the wonderful religion of Israel to common causes
acting upon heathen religion, there is no real work
of revelation in this gradual progress from lower to
higher stages. It would be quite useless, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
point of view of this book, to enter on the fruitless
discussion as to whether in the evolution of religion
we have to deal with a natural process or with a supernatural
revelation. Is any such antithesis necessary?
Surely the one can come through the other. If revelation
is to reach us it must come through the ordinary
processes of our minds; the recognition that it is from
God cannot be authenticated to us by any miracle or
outward authority, but simply by the possibility of
the mind, which God has made, being able to recognise
its Maker. It may be more of a difficulty to
others that we should have such erroneous conceptions
of history in a Book that has been regarded as
infallible on these matters. We have to face the
fact, from which there is no escape, that the historian
may not have known the origin of the things of
which he wrote, or may have intentionally obscured
the fact of the heathen origin of customs that
had become to all pious Israelites expressions of
Jehovah's special revelation to Israel. If we are
going to call this fraud, then it means that we are
going to force on that early age a conception of
historical accuracy which it certainly did not possess,
and which, as a matter of fact, is only a late demand
of the human mind. And after all, there was truth
in this reference of all their religion to the revelation
of Jehovah. It witnesses to the fact that behind
even the crudest religion there is something which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
defies explanation, and that we have in heathen
religions the slow dawning consciousness of God
within man's soul. In Israel these things never
stood still. That central idea of the localisation of
Jehovah grew too small to contain the widening
conception of Him as it was evolved through
reflection and national experience, until the Prophets
burst forth with the proclamation that He was the
God of the whole earth, and His relation to Israel
not tribal or territorial, but moral, and only to be
maintained by righteousness and true holiness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reader is recommended to make a careful study of the following
passages, which are among the most important adduced by the critics as
evidence for the non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.</p>

<p>(1) Mosaic authorship is never claimed for the Pentateuch as a whole.
Only in certain places is it noted that Moses wrote down special things
(Exod. xvii. 14; xxiv. 4; xxxiv. 27; Num. xxxiii. 2; Deut. xxxi. 9, 22, 24).
Moses is consistently spoken of in the third person, and it is hardly likely
that this is a style purposely adopted, or the statement of Num. xii. 3
would be extraordinary in the circumstances. Obviously the last
chapter of Deuteronomy was not written by him, nor is the common
opinion that it was added by Joshua at all probable, for there is no
difference in style from the rest of the book discernible, and, moreover,
Dan is referred to (Deut. xxxiv. 1; cp. also Gen. xiv. 14), which was
not so named until after the conquest. (Josh. xix. 47; Judges xviii. 29.)
Would Moses need to authenticate his history of contemporaneous
events by quoting from what are regarded as ancient books: from the
Book of the Wars of Jehovah (Num. xxi. 14), wars which could have
only just commenced, or from the poem which refers to the victory over
Sihon (Num. xxi. 27 ff.), which took place at the very end of the forty
years' wandering?</p>

<p>(2) The standpoint as a whole is that of an age later than Moses.
The remark in Gen. xxxvi. 31 can only have had any meaning in the
age of David when Edom was in submission to Israel. A late date is
also needed for the following passages: Gen. xii. 6; xiii. 7; xxxiv. 7
("in Israel"! cp. Judges xx. 10; 2 Sam. xiii. 12); Lev. xviii. 27;
Deut. ii. 12; iv. 38. In fact, the whole geographical outlook is
that of an inhabitant of Western Palestine, as may be seen from the
use of the term "Seaward" to indicate the west, and of "Negeb,"
or the desert land, for the south. These terms are used even in the
description of the Tabernacle, which, if taken from the site of Mount
Sinai, would be altogether wrong and meaningless. Compare Num.
xxii. 1; xxxiv. 15; Deut. i. 1, 5; iii. 8; iv. 41, 46, 49: "beyond the
Jordan," showing clearly that the writer's position is in Palestine, west
of the Jordan.</p>

<p>(3) There is no trace in the history of any observance of the Levitical
ritual until after the exile; the day of atonement, the sin-offering,
the high-priest, all are unheard of until this date. Nor can it be
claimed that it was the ignorance of the common people, or their
apostasy, that was responsible for this condition of things. The great
leaders of the various reformations are apparently also quite ignorant
that none but a priest could sacrifice, and none but a Levite take charge
of the ark. Samuel, who was not a Levite, sleeps beside the ark and
offers sacrifice. Elijah does nothing to recall the people to the ritual of
Leviticus.</p>

<p>(4) The conclusion is that, while later ages were right in attributing
to Moses the founding of their religion and some of their ritual, all the
accumulation of law, which had only been the growth of many centuries,
has been placed to his credit. What the actual contribution of Moses
was it is now impossible to say, but the original of the Ten Words and
of the Book of the Covenant (Exod. xx. 2&ndash;xxiii. 33) may well go back
to that age, as may be seen from the relative simplicity of the laws and
rules. For example, compare the simple regulations for the altar in
Exod. xx. 24 with the elaborate altar described in Exod. xxvii. 1&ndash;8.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="vspace large"><a name="Lecture_III" id="Lecture_III">Lecture III</a><br />

<span class="subhead">MOSAISM</span></h3>

<p>The national consciousness of Israel goes back to
a series of remarkable events in which the nation
was born, and which are too deeply graven on the
mind of the people to be mere legends without
historical foundation. These events are the deliverance
from the bondage in Egypt and the great
covenant made with Jehovah at Sinai. The indispensable
personal centre, round which these events
revolve, is that of the great national leader, Moses.
The fact that, outside the Pentateuch and the closely
connected Book of Joshua, little is known of the
work of Moses until after the exile, has given rise to
doubts concerning his historical reality. If we take
the writings of the Old Testament that are contemporary
with the period they describe, there stand
out in indisputable primacy the writings of the great
literary Prophets. To these modern criticism has
rightly turned to discover the opinions, customs, and
religion, prevailing in the Eighth Century; and it is
claimed that by these writings we can test the
historical value of the Pentateuch, and of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
historical books. Now it must be admitted that in
the pre-exilic Prophets the mention of Moses is less
frequent than we should expect from the position
which is claimed for him in the books of Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The
Prophets do appeal with one consent to the original
covenant of Jehovah with Israel, to the fulfilment of
which they would recall the nation; but only rarely
is the name of Moses associated with that covenant.
There are only four references to Moses in the Prophets
before the exile (Hosea xii. 13&mdash;Moses not actually
named; Micah vi. 4; Jer. xv. 1; Isa. lxiii. 12&mdash;reckoned
post-exilic by critics), and in none of these is Moses
referred to as a law-giver, but as a prophet and
national deliverer. We have to come to Prophets
writing after the exile to find any reference to the
legislative work of Moses (Mal. iv. 4; Dan. ix. 11&ndash;13).
The purpose of the prophetic writings is moral rather
than historical, and this forbids putting more
evidential weight upon this argument from silence
than it will bear; but in face of their continual appeal
to the covenant of Sinai, this silence is at least
significant. Evidently Moses was not a name
to conjure with in their age. (Compare Jer.
xxxi. 31, 32, where the mention of the name of
Moses would have been most natural.)</p>

<p>We have, on these and other grounds, to disregard
the later idea that Moses was the only law-giver of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Israel and the author of the Pentateuch, although the
fact that the later legislation could only find sanction
as it was included under his name, points to him as in
some way the initiator of Israel's great Code of Laws.
While in addition to this, it must be admitted that a
great deal of the story of his life is due to the growth
of legend, there is no need to regard the figure of
Moses as entirely mythical. The events by which a
motley crowd of serfs became a nation and covenanted
themselves to an almost new religion not only need
for their explanation a great interpreter, but also a
great leader; and this demand and need Moses fills.
We may therefore safely regard Moses as one of the
great Founders of Religion.</p>

<p>We have now to enquire how much of the marvellous
story of his life can be safely reckoned as history.
The document which gives the earliest, and therefore
the most trustworthy, story of his life is dated by the
critics in the Ninth Century, although it is not denied
that it may, and probably does, go back for its
material to a much earlier period. This document,
known to the critics as "J," owes its origin to early
prophetic influence. In this document, as might be
expected from the analogy in similar cases (compare
the absence of the birth stories in Mark), the story
of the birth and finding of Moses is omitted; it is
probably nothing more than an effort to find a
popular explanation of his name, as derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
<i>Mashah</i>, "to draw out." A much more likely
origin of the name is found by modern scholars in
the Egyptian word for "son" (<i>Mesu</i>). The important
thing to be noticed is that in this early document
he appears first of all in Midian, although there
are indications which show that it is known that he
had previously been in Egypt. Here, alone in the
wilderness, or in intercourse with the strange
Bedawin who still inhabit that region, there came
to him a revelation of Jehovah and the call to
deliver Israel from their bondage. He returned
to Egypt with a message at once religious and
national. He calls upon the Israelites to leave Egypt
and to seek a covenant with Jehovah at His shrine at
Sinai. During a plague, the passage of the Red Sea
was effected under conditions that were interpreted to
be due to the direct intervention of Jehovah; and, the
returning tide cutting off the pursuing Egyptians who
challenged their flight, the Israelites stood delivered
from their enemies and their first trust in Jehovah was
vindicated. It is not for us to enquire into the exact
causes which proved so favourable to the Israelites
and so disastrous to the Egyptians; we only need to
know that they were interpreted religiously. Then
around Mount Sinai, with its impressive solitude and
its awful storms, Moses gathered the people, imparted
the secret of the new worship, made a solemn covenant
by which the people of Israel became for ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the people of Jehovah, and probably laid down some
rudiments of legislation fitted for their primitive and
nomadic condition. This much at least the after
history demands as the irreducible minimum.</p>

<p>If this is at all an accurate view of the founding of
the religion of Jehovah, then we are faced with the
phenomenon of a nation practically adopting a
new religion. We do not ignore "revelation"
when we feel compelled to seek for natural causes
which might prepare the way for this event; and
this we may attempt by an enquiry into the meaning
of the name "Jehovah."</p>

<p>It should be noted at the outset that "Jehovah" is
a personal name, like that of Zeus or Poseidon, conveying
the idea of some aspect of deity. The meaning
of the name is exceedingly obscure. The general
name for deity common to all Semites, and therefore
belonging to the undivided primitive stock, is "El,"
meaning either "the Mighty One" or, and more in
accord with Semitic conceptions of God, "the
Leader." The meaning of the name "Jehovah" is
difficult to discover, because in the first place the
exact pronunciation of the word has been lost,
probably beyond recovery.</p>

<p>The word "Jehovah" is a hybrid compound, and
as a matter of fact was never used as a name for God
until the Reformation. We can be certain only that
the consonants of the word were <i>JHVH</i> (or <i>YHWH</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Hebrew pronunciation). This extraordinary state
of things is accounted for by the fact that for
centuries the Hebrew Scriptures were "unpointed" or
unvocalised&mdash;that is, the consonants only were written
and the necessary connecting vowels were taught
orally, and only retained in the memory for use when
the Scriptures were read aloud. When in the Ninth
Century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> it was likely that the pronunciation of
the sacred language would be entirely forgotten, a device
for its preservation was made whereby the vowel
pronunciation was indicated by means of "points"
placed chiefly underneath the consonantal text;
very much like the dots and dashes used for vowels
in Pitman's system of shorthand. When, however, it
came to the "pointing" of JHVH, it was found
that the pronunciation of this word had been entirely
lost. Reverence for the name of God had become
so exaggerated that, in reading aloud from the
Scriptures, wherever the sacred name occurred
another word had always been substituted. This
word was one of respect, but of less marked exaltation&mdash;<i>Adonai</i>,
equal to our word "Lord." The only
course open to the punctuators was that of inserting
under the consonants JHVH, the vowels (with
suitable euphonic modifications) of the word
<i>Adonai</i>, with the result that we get the conflate "Jehovah,"
a word which has become invested with so
much solemnity to our ears, but which was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
not the right pronunciation, and which has never
been used by the Jews. Scholars have endeavoured,
at present without any universally accepted result,
to recover the lost pronunciation by linguistic
enquiries, with the desire to discover what the word
originally meant, in the hope that it would throw
some light on the origin of the religion founded by
Moses. In Exod. iii. 13 ff. (R.&nbsp;V. margin) we have
the traditional explanation of the word, an explanation
which is not altogether satisfactory from a
grammatical point of view; the great Hebraist
Ewald goes so far as to pronounce it highly artificial.
It has been objected that the man who wrote this
account, about 750 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, surely understood his own
language. Probably; but that is not to say that he
understood the etymology of it, for etymology is a
new science, and has upset many popular derivations
in the case of our own language. If the explanation
given in Exodus is correct, and we cannot with
certainty put anything much better in its place, then
the meaning of the word "Jehovah" would be "He
that is," perhaps an equivalent in Hebrew form to
the Western idea of "The Eternal." Only one of the
numerous guesses as to the meaning of the original
name need be quoted here: that the word comes
from a verb, <i>hawah</i>, meaning either "to fall," or "to
blow." Similar ideas would seem to account for
either of these meanings. "He who blows," looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
like the name for the Tempest God, while "that
which falls" has been taken to indicate a fallen
meteorite, which may have been preserved as a symbol
of Jehovah. When we remember the thunderstorms
at Sinai, and the common belief that thunder was
a special theophany of Jehovah, these ideas are not to
be hastily dismissed as altogether incredible. Nor
should we be prevented from considering such an
idea from the prejudice that it would make the
origin of the religion of Israel a piece of Nature-worship
and superstition. God has taken man
where He has found him, and none can dare to
define the limits of childish and crude conceptions
within which the Spirit of God can begin His work
in man's mind.</p>

<p>The conclusion derived from the examination of
the meaning of the name "Jehovah" must therefore
remain open until some further light is thrown on
the subject. (Scholars usually adopt the pronunciation,
<i>Yahwe</i>, as our nearest approach to the
original.)</p>

<p>An endeavour has been made to discover the
origin of the religion of Israel from the persistent
connection of Jehovah with the locality of Mount
Sinai. This idea continues long after in the Promised
Land (Deut. xxxiii. 2; Judges v. 5), and Elijah takes
a long journey back to the sacred spot, presumably
to get into closer touch with Jehovah (1 Kings xix.).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
With the prevailing beliefs of that age in the
localisation of the god, this connection must be
thought of as of more than accidental significance.
It is fair to assume that the seat of Jehovah at Sinai
must have been known before the great covenant,
and is indeed required by the narrative itself
(Exod. iii.; iv. 27), while recent discoveries are said
to prove that the traditional Sinai must have been a
sacred place from the earliest times. Moses, however,
is clearly represented as coming to know of Jehovah
during his stay in Midian. The exact means of the
revelation is said to have been the sight of a bush on
fire, yet miraculously unconsumed. What actually
lies behind this story&mdash;whether it is a creation of the
religious imagination which sees "every common
bush afire with God"&mdash;it is useless for us to try and
discover. A natural explanation has been sought in
the fact that Jethro, the Kenite, was the priest of
Midian, and presumably of some shrine of Jehovah.
Certainly Jethro knew the name of Jehovah, but
apparently only regarded Him as one of the gods,
until the marvellous deliverance of the Exodus proved
Him to be the greatest of gods (Exod. xviii. 9&ndash;11).
Jethro performs an act of sacrifice to Jehovah, in the
presence of Aaron and the elders, that looks
remarkably like an act of initiation by which Israel
are introduced to the worship of Jehovah by the
regular priest of the shrine (Exod. xviii. 12). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
hypothesis is further strengthened by the fact that
the Kenites are found later dwelling in Palestine
(Judges i. 16), and are always remembered long after
as the friends of the Israelites (1 Sam. xv. 6;
xxvii. 10; xxx. 29). The inference from this is that
Moses first learned of Jehovah from his father-in-law
Jethro, but that he understood more of the character
of Jehovah than Jethro, and by his superior religious
consciousness conceived of Him as in some way
Supreme who to Jethro had been only one of the
desert gods.</p>

<p>This theory would certainly be strengthened if
Sinai could be identified, not with the traditional
site of <i>Jebel Musa</i> in the southern part of the Sinaitic
peninsula, but with some spot in the land of
Midian, across the gulf of Akaba. This does indeed
seem necessary from the narrative, for from the most
natural interpretation of Exod. iii. 1, Horeb, the mount
of God, was in Midian. It is generally taken for
granted that Horeb and Sinai are identical; the
respective names are used by different documents.
It is said that, for some reasons, Midian would fit in
with the record of the journey through the wilderness
better than the Sinaitic peninsula. If the parallelism
of Sinai with Seir in Deut. xxxiii. 2 can be taken to
show identity, as is natural, we have a further confirmation,
for Seir is in Midian.</p>

<p>The grave difficulty of all this is that it would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the religion of Jehovah a distinct importation. Is
such a thing as its reception by the Hebrews credible
on this account? The idea of a nation changing its
religion is certainly repugnant to the Semitic mind
(Jer. ii. 10, 11), and some more natural connection
seems necessary, both from the narrative and from
general considerations. Now the narrative hints
that the religion was not entirely new (Exod. vi. 3), but
was known to the Patriarchs under different forms;
while the sanctity of Sinai would seem to have been
already known to some of the tribes (Exod. iv. 27).
There is nothing here definite enough for us to proceed
to historical certainty, but it is fair to suppose
that the shrine at Sinai was known to the Patriarchs
in their wanderings, and that Jehovah would be worshipped;
as would any other local god whose territory
they happened to be in. Grant that this was
partly known to the Hebrew slaves in Egypt; that
Moses received the revelation of the power of Jehovah
in his exile in Midian, and by a splendid leap of
inspiration identified the actual shrine and the Person
of Jehovah with the Mighty Spirit dimly known to the
Patriarchs, and we have an explanation that is natural
and is also true; for the Object of man's worship has
been One through all history. When the successful
passage of the Red Sea and the defeat of the Egyptians
were interpreted by Moses as the direct intervention
of Jehovah, the transition to the great covenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
is made possible. All this may be very contrary to
the traditional idea of how Moses received the revelation
of Jehovah, but the facts do point this way;
and it is not for us to deny that the Spirit of
God could work through these natural events and
through the mind of this commanding personality,
and so bring about this identification of Jehovah
and the Great Spirit of the Patriarchal thought,
which was to lead to such great results for religion.</p>

<p>We are now free to investigate what the character
of the religion introduced by Moses actually was.</p>

<p>(1) <i>General Character.</i> A careful examination of
its character shows that while it is by no means
identical with the religion taught by the Prophets,
and while it retained many heathen ideas and
customs, yet it contained within itself the promise
and guarantee of development. We have already
had occasion to notice that it is not pure Monotheism.
Jehovah is not the only God; He is the only God for
Israel. The heathen deities are still regarded as
having a real existence. Neither can it be called a
purely spiritual religion, for Jehovah is rather said to
have a spirit than to be a spirit; He has a form
which, though terrible in its effect on the beholder,
by reason of its glory, can nevertheless be seen; He
inhabits a special place, which is His sacred territory,
and on this Moses stumbles all unwittingly in
Midian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Still more emphatically against the idea of a purely
spiritual religion is the fact&mdash;which the editors have
done their best to hide, but not successfully&mdash;that
images of some kind were allowed, or existed unreproved.
The Ephod, of which we hear so often, was
evidently at one time an idol. The meaning of the
word is of something "covered," as may be seen from
Isa. xxx. 22, where the feminine form of the word
(<i>aphuddah</i>) is used of the gold plating of images; but
according to a later idea (Exod. xxviii. 6&ndash;14), the
Ephod formed part of the dress of the High Priest,
and was a kind of embroidered waistcoat. This
explanation, however, does violence to a number of
passages where the Ephod is mentioned. Gideon
expended seventeen hundred shekels of gold on an
Ephod which he "set up" in Ophrah (Jud. viii. 26 f.);
this cannot be a waistcoat. Only the explanation
that the Ephod was an image can do justice to the
reference in Judges xvii. 5, and it suits the passage
in 1 Sam. xxi. 9, if we think of the sword hanging
behind an image. If the ephod was nothing more
than a waistcoat by which lots were determined, we
have to explain why it is so sharply condemned in
Judges viii. 27, and why the text of 1 Sam. xiv. 18,
which in the Septuagint reads "ephod," in the
Hebrew text has been altered to read "ark"; an
alteration which is quite impossible here, as the ark
was at this time in Kirjath Jearim, and, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
was never used for the purpose of obtaining oracles.
(The only explanation is that some scribe has made
this alteration because he knew that there was
something idolatrous about the ephod.) Even as
late as Hosea (iii. 4) we find the ephod mentioned
in a connection where it can only stand for an
object of idolatrous worship. It is certainly strange
that the same name should be in use for an
image, and then later for a garment of the high-priest;
but the likely explanation of this is that the
image was at one time clothed with a dress, as was
usual (Jer. x. 9), and that in the pockets of this the
lots were kept. When the use of the image became
offensive the garment was retained as part of the
high-priest's dress. The transition is made more
natural if we can suppose that the Priest of the
Oracle, in the early days, was accustomed to put on
the garment of the image, under the customary idea
that thus the divine knowledge of the idol would be
communicated to him. In 2 Kings xviii. 4, we read
of <i>Nehushtan</i>, the brazen serpent which Moses had
made, being used idolatrously; but perhaps this has
been wrongly ascribed to Moses. From the intimate
connection of bull-worship with the worship of
Jehovah, it would seem that the bull was regarded
as a symbol of Jehovah; a similar idea may have
instituted Aaron's golden calf. While admitting the
force of this evidence, we must still keep open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
possibility that the religion instituted by Moses was
of a purer type, but was never strong enough to
drive out the remnants of heathen practice.</p>

<p>More indisputable evidence of the materialistic
conception of the Person of Jehovah is found in the
reverence paid to what is known as "the ark of
Jehovah," the making of which is certainly ascribed
to Moses. The name "the ark of the covenant," was
not the original name given to the ark, but is taken
from the incident recorded in Deut. x. 1&ndash;5. The
idea that the ark was built to contain the tables of
the Law does not appear until the time of Deuteronomy,
and is quite unknown to the older strata of the
Pentateuch. In these older strata all mention of the
actual making of the ark is omitted, although there
is evidence that they did contain an account of its
preparation and meaning. Enough, however, is told
us of the reverential treatment of it, to show that it
was a symbol of higher sanctity than a mere receptacle
for the stones of the law would be likely to be. It is
certainly very closely identified with Jehovah Himself,
as may be seen from Num. x. 35. (This is in
poetic form, and is therefore likely to be a very early
fragment. It should be noticed that the ark
apparently starts of itself.) Its presence in the battlefield
ensures victory, while its absence brings about
defeat (Num. xiv. 42&ndash;45; 1 Sam. iv. 3&ndash;7; v. 1 ff.).
It can hardly be that the ark was taken for Jehovah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Himself, but it must have contained something that
was closely identified with Jehovah; a box is not
built except with the idea of holding something. We
have seen that it is unlikely that that something was
originally the two tables of the law; was it something
else of stone which made the transference to
the tables of the law at once necessary and natural?
Was it a stone image of Jehovah? It has been
conjectured that it may have contained meteoritic
stones, which would agree with the proposed derivation
of "Jehovah" from the Storm God of Sinai.
There is nothing in the Old Testament which gives
any support to these conjectures, but in face of the
fact that the original narrative of the making of the
ark has been omitted, and in view of the ideas of
religion which were common in that period, we
cannot say that they are absolutely excluded from
consideration. The ark was certainly bound up with
the idea of war, and would seem to have been kept in
a soldier's tent. It was transferred to the dark inner
temple till 586 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and from that date all trace of it
is lost. The Priest's Code ("P") makes provision for
it in the second temple, but we have unimpeachable
Jewish testimony that the shrine of the inner temple
was absolutely empty (Josephus, <i>War of the Jews</i>,
v. v. § 5). Jeremiah may have been aware of the
original significance of the ark as tending towards
idolatry, and hence his words in Jer. iii. 16.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
(2) <i>Ordinances of Worship.</i> It remains for us to
enquire into the character of the religion founded by
Moses by an examination of some of the outstanding
ordinances that regulated the idea of worship.</p>

<p>Here the traditional ascription of the fully
developed ritual of the Book of Leviticus to Moses
has to be set aside, on the consideration that we have
no record of its observance until late in the period of
the monarchy, and from then it can be traced as a
gradual growth of custom and ideal until its complete
observance after the Exile.</p>

<p>There does not seem to have been any priesthood
of the exclusive Levitical order founded by Moses.
The story of the Levites in Exod. xxxii. can only
be a late story, for there is no record of their monopoly
of the ritual service until the Reform under
Josiah: Joshua, an Ephraimite, is the "servant
of the tent"; Samuel, also an Ephraimite, sleeps
beside the ark (1 Sam. iii. 3); David and Solomon
assume a kind of chief priesthood (2 Sam. vi. 13;
1 Kings viii. 5, 62 ff.), and of course neither of them
were Levites. The story in Judges xvii. gives what
is perhaps the true position of the Levites: anyone
could be consecrated as a family priest, but the
presence of a Levite was reckoned propitious. Down
to a very late age sacrifice seems to have remained
largely a tribal or family act, and although a descendant
of Moses' tribe (Levi) was regarded as possessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
special advantage, there was no law by which Levites
alone were reckoned capable of discharging priestly
functions.</p>

<p>In the matter of sacrifice, it would seem that Moses
simply adopted what was a very ancient and common
practice. In face of the evident neglect of the Levitical
ritual in matters of sacrifice, both by the
common people and by such great reformers as
Samuel and Elijah, together with the fact that in
the teaching of the prophets doubts are cast on
its divine origin (Isa. i. 11; Amos v. 25; Micah
vi. 6&ndash;8), we cannot infer that the detailed and
explicit commands concerning sacrifice found in the
Book of Leviticus are the work of Moses, or belong
to an early age. To the Prophets, sacrifice is always
reminiscent of paganism. The time when the change
came in may be detected in the different value given
to sacrifice by the post-exilic prophets (Mal. i. 13 f.),
while the incompatibility of the two views, prophetic
and priestly, can be seen from the addition which has
been made to Ps. li., to bring it into accord with the
later view.</p>

<p>Neither is it possible for us to believe that the
elaborate shrine known as the Tabernacle owed its
existence to Moses. The impossibility of transporting
the cumbrous fixtures through the wilderness had been
noticed before the modern era of critical study. A
close examination of the details of construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
shows that it is nothing more than an ideal projection
from the mind of a priestly writer who believed that
a tent-like counterpart of Ezekiel's temple was essential
to Israel's worship in the wilderness. It is enough
to recall that the tabernacle of the priestly writer's
imagination is quite unknown to the historical books.
In Exod. xxxiii. 7 ff., which may be seen to be only
a fragment of an early document, since it starts
abruptly by describing "the" tent, which is known
as the Tent of Meeting, we have what has been taken
to be the Tabernacle; but it is nothing more than a
tent for keeping the ark in.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Legislation.</i> How much of the legislation of
the Pentateuch is to be ascribed to Moses we cannot
tell. Too many hands have been at work on it
for the original to be discovered. A remarkable
discovery was made in the year 1901 of some
enormous <i>steles</i>, which bear in cuneiform characters
what is now known as the Code of Hammurabi, the
oldest code of laws in the world, the date of which
is reckoned to be 2250 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> They presuppose an
advanced state of civilisation and morality existing in
the Euphrates valley at that period. The agreement
between the Pentateuchal Code and the Code of
Hammurabi argues dependence of the former on the
latter to a very considerable extent, and supplies a still
further testimony to the extent to which the religion
of Israel is indebted to Babylon. The exact bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
of this discovery upon critical theories, and especially
upon the date of the Pentateuch has perhaps hardly
been estimated yet; it does not, however, refute the
theory which denies that the Pentateuch as it stands
is from the hand of Moses.</p>

<p>We naturally think of the Decalogue as the work
of Moses, but here we are faced by the difficulty that
the Decalogue appears to exist in three recensions
(Exod. xx. 1&ndash;17; xxxiv. 14&ndash;28; Deut. v. 6&ndash;21). The
account in Exod. xxxiv., which forms part of the
document "J," is reckoned to be the oldest of these,
and the original of this might well go back to the time
of Moses. It has been objected that the Decalogue is
too ethical to suit the time of Moses, but is this not
because we are inclined to read into the Ten Commandments
far more than is to be found there? It
can be shown that they are little more than ten
laws of "rights." A special difficulty is found in
ascribing the second commandment to this age, in
view of its frequent uncensured breach; but perhaps
there is some difference that escapes us between a
molten image, which is prescribed in the first draft
(Exod. xxxiv. 17), and the later prohibition of the
graven image (Exod. xx. 4).</p>

<p>In the foregoing examination we have allowed for
the most rigorous demands of advanced criticism,
demands which may have to be modified as criticism
becomes more of a science, but there remains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
need to discover what there was, on these critical
assumptions, in the Mosaic religion that provided
the way for a further advance into the faith which
became the glory of Israel. What is it that makes the
difference between Mosaism and the heathen Semitic
religions, a difference which was to make the gradual
growth of a pure Monotheism possible?</p>

<p>The first important element which needs to be
reckoned with is that it was a religion of choice
rather than a religion of nature. We saw that it was
difficult to conceive how the religion of Jehovah could
have been adopted by Israel unless there had been
some previous contact. What is so difficult to understand
is nevertheless the one element that contained
the possibility of progress. The relation of Israel to
Jehovah was neither by physical descent nor through
the connection of the god with the land, as with the
heathen Semitic religions. Jehovah was at first conceived
of as the God of the tribe only, but even this
was not by nature, but by His gracious choice. Their
land was given to them by Jehovah, but His natural
connection was with a far distant shrine. This fact
in itself must have rendered necessary some more
spiritual conception of His habitation, and, though
hard enough for the common people to realise, when
they entered Canaan and found a full-grown cultus
and religion in connection with the god of the land
already in possession, it was this fact upon which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Prophets fastened and which could not be denied:
the religion of Jehovah was a matter of choice and
not of racial or local connection. That choice had
been ratified by solemn covenant, to which the
Prophets appealed. The relation between Jehovah
and Israel depended therefore on the conditions of
the covenant being faithfully kept. When we compare
the religions of the other Semites, which made
the relation of the god and his people one which
nothing could break, and from which neither the god
nor the people could escape, we can see how this
difference constituted one of the ethical germs of the
religion which was destined to grow into fuller power
and life.</p>

<p>There was another important conception, which
was intensified by the fact that the religion of Jehovah
was a religion of choice: that of the jealousy of
Jehovah. This was often interpreted, especially in
the pre-prophetic period, in a very crude and in even
a cruel way. The jealousy of Jehovah was very like
the human passion: uncertain, arbitrary and irrational,
manifesting itself according to the popular mind in
outbreaks of fury for ceremonial mistakes, or for
causes even less comprehensible (Num. iii. 4; 2 Sam.
vi. 7). In all the religions it was thought to be a
serious thing to depart from the allegiance to the
rightful god, and sure to lay one open to his jealousy
and vengeance; but something more is now found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
in this idea as it develops in Hebrew thought: it
is that the jealousy of Jehovah is due to the great
difference between Him and the other gods, a
difference which came to be recognised as one of
character. Something of this must go back to
Moses himself.</p>

<p>This difference is also expressed in the idea that
He is a God of righteousness. The word "righteousness"
does not always have in the Hebrew Scriptures
the absolute meaning which it has for us. It was
rather equal to our word "rights," which we often
employ quite unethically. Jehovah was one who
gave right judgments when questions were submitted
and answered by the lot, and One who brought
victory to the right. It was undoubtedly Israel's
right that was chiefly considered, but there was
hidden in it an ethical germ which was to bring forth
notable fruit when man's sense of right was widened.</p>

<p>This at least was the mark of the new religion
which Moses impressed on the people, impressed
with such a force that it could never be quite
forgotten. It had new thoughts pregnant with
meaning for the mind of man and for the future of
religion, and these became the fulcrum of the
Prophets' appeal. From the bosom of this people
was to come forth One who was to reveal the Father
as perfectly righteous and impartial, and who
demands for His service a righteousness that must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
far exceed that of the straitest observers of external
religion.</p>

<p>It would be easy for us to despise this day of small
beginnings, or to refuse to see in it any real revelation
of God at all. Doubtless this enquiry may necessitate
a change in our conceptions of the work of Moses,
but it is one that we are forced to by a multitude of
facts, and we must find a theory of inspiration wide
enough to fit them. Crude as we may make the
beginnings of Israel's faith, natural as we may feel
are the laws by which it worked towards its growth, we
have not been able to get any nearer to some of those
ultimate questions which ask how religion begins,
what the nature of revelation is, and how it comes to
man's mind. We need not think that God had to
break in on the mind of Moses, so that the personality
of the man was in abeyance while God worked
through him. When God wishes to bring men to a
higher truth He does not supernaturally communicate
it; He makes human nature to produce personalities
whose minds come naturally to the truth. There
can be no separation of natural and supernatural
here; wherever that separation is to be made,
we certainly cannot make it. There can be no
meaning in revelation, and no possibility of it,
unless God has made man's mind to be growingly
in touch with Him and to be capable of
receiving His revelation by the natural working of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
thought, so that it seems to spring up within his
own consciousness.</p>

<p>Deeper into this question we are not called upon
to go at present, but no one can object that it is less
reverent, or that it shows signs of a decay of faith, if
men can see God to-day not only in the extraordinary
and the supernatural, but also in the ordinary and
the natural. If the recognition of God depends on
spiritual vision, then those who refuse to narrow the
limits within which God can be seen, and who therefore
welcome all truth with gladness and without
fear, are not to be called godless and unspiritual.</p>

<p>We should learn to be thankful for Moses, for he
was faithful as far as he knew; if we were as faithful
in proportion to the fuller light which has come to
us, religion would be a very real and inclusive thing.
We should also learn to take heart, if from these
beginnings such mighty movements have sprung.
The mistakes inevitable to the human mind do not
destroy the possibility of revelation, the error cannot
everlastingly obscure the truth, nor in the long run
will evil triumph over good. It was possible in that far
off age, it was possible in all ages, it is possible now,
for a mind still far from the true conception of the
ultimate nature of God to yet grasp something, and
by a supreme faith in the leading of a Mighty Power
to lift a whole nation, and through it the world, one
stage further on in goodness and truth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As an introduction to Lecture IV. the reader is advised to make a careful
study of Judges i. 1&ndash;ii. 5, a mutilated fragment of a very early and reliable
account of the invasion of Canaan. The opening words (verse 1) refer the events
which follow to the period after the death of Joshua; but the Book of Joshua has
already recorded the complete conquest of Canaan, so that there can be no place
for this further invasion on a far less ambitious plan, and apparently with less
successful results. It will be noticed, however, that this account easily falls away
from the main body of the narrative; Judges ii. 6 follows naturally after Joshua
xxiv. 28, and ignores what comes between. We have, therefore, in this account
another history of the conquest of Canaan, which contradicts altogether the
impression&mdash;which we get from reading the Book of Joshua&mdash;that the conquest of
Canaan was effected by the tribes acting in unison, that it was complete, and that
the conquered were exterminated; it records a movement of tribes acting
independently, there is no "conquest" in the ordinary sense of the term, but
a footing is obtained alongside the original inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>This account of a gradual immigration of tribes is confirmed by the discovery
of inscriptions, which seem to show that there were some tribes of the Hebrews
in Palestine before the traditional date of the Conquest, and even before the
Exodus.</p>

<p>Until quite lately the history of Egypt has thrown no light on these events.
It has not even been possible to identify with any certainty the Pharaoh under
whom the Exodus took place. One identification is now fairly certain. The
Pharaoh who enslaved the Israelites was Rameses III., for discoveries have
proved that it was he who built Pithom (Exod. i. 11); the Exodus has therefore
been referred to the reigns of Merneptah or Seti II., his immediate
successors. The objection to this is that in these reigns both the peninsula of
Sinai and the land of Palestine were under full Egyptian control, and therefore
the Exodus must be put later on, when this control slackened. This would bring
the Exodus to the date of 1200&ndash;1180 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> and the Conquest some fifty years later.</p>

<p>The latest discoveries tend to throw this result into confusion. Names, which
it is proposed to identify with tribes of the Israelites, have been found in inscriptions
belonging to earlier reigns. On an inscription of Rameses II. the name of
Asher is found as dwelling in North Palestine. In a list of Thotmes III. (still
earlier, Sixteenth Century, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) we find the names Jacob and Joseph in the significant
combination, Jacob-el and Joseph-el, used to describe the Dan-Ephraim
district of Palestine. This makes it more likely that the Tel-el-Amarna tablets
(dated Fourteenth Century, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) refer to the Hebrews. In these letters,
addressed to Amenophis IV., the King of Jerusalem appeals for help against
an invasion of the <i>Habiri</i>, who are led by Abd Ashera. The invasion is not
by a large force, as may be seen from the fact that it is thought thirty or forty
Egyptian soldiers will be sufficient for the purpose of resisting their attacks.
More certain than any of these references is the occurrence of the name of Israel
on a Stele of Merneptah, in connection with a recital of his triumphs in Syria.
The form in which this reference is made leaves no doubt that, by this period,
Israel was already settled in Palestine. ("Israel is laid waste, its corn is annihilated.")
There is no confirmation of a Syrian campaign under Merneptah, and
it may be that in accordance with the fashion of the age, he is including among his
victories the exploits of his predecessors; this would agree with the earlier date for
the occupation of Canaan by Israel which the previous references seem to require.</p>

<p>The exact bearing of these discoveries has yet to be determined, but they either
require us to put the date of the Exodus earlier, which would in itself be difficult,
or, what would bring light on many problems, assume that not all the tribes were
in bondage in Egypt, and that the invasion of Canaan by various tribes, only
long after welded into a nation, was spread over a long period.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE INFLUENCE OF CANAAN</span></h2>

<p>If the nation of Israel may be said to have been
born in captivity, baptised in the Red Sea, and
awakened to national consciousness at Mount Sinai,
then the settlement in Canaan corresponds to the no
less critical period of adolescence, when, training and
tutelage being over, youth must choose its own path
and fight its way in the world. Certain it is that the
entrance into Canaan largely determined the future
of this people, for it must have profoundly modified
the national character, turning as it did nomadic
tribes into a settled and civilised people; but above
all, and what more concerns us, it proved extremely
critical for the fate of that as yet untried revelation of
Jehovah, which had still to win its way against the
heathenism of the common people, and was now by
this new experience called upon to measure its
strength against the attraction of a competing
faith.</p>

<p>The peculiar and pathetic love of the Jews for
Canaan is largely due to the remembrance that it
was not their own land but the long promised gift of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Jehovah, standing therefore to all time as the material
proof of His love for Israel; while their estimate of it
was intensely deepened by the wilderness experience
which preceded. That estimate seems to us somewhat
exaggerated, for to-day Palestine has almost
given up the struggle against the always threatening
advance of the desert. It has certainly changed for
the worse under neglect and misrule, but it can never
have been a too indulgent land; only comparison
with the bare and awful desert can have called forth
the description, "a land flowing with milk and
honey." With the long memory of restless nomadic
life and the bitter thought of bondage, any land would
seem welcome that offered them freedom and safety;
while to those approaching it from the desert it seemed
as fair and fruitful a land as men could desire.</p>

<p>All lands have contributed largely to the character
of the nations they have reared, and the wilderness
ancestry and the character of Canaan have played
their part in the development of Israel.</p>

<p>The very geographical position of Canaan helps us to
understand the Hebrews, and even to see how it was
that in this land it was possible to nurture from such
unpromising beginnings the wonderful development of
religion that was to make this smallest of all lands
one of the most sacred spots on earth, and this strange
and limited people among the greatest contributors to
the moral and religious ideas of humanity. Crushed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
between the sea and the desert, hemmed in by great
military powers, the little buffer state itself the very
crossways of East and West, its roads never long at
rest from the tramp of armies; here was a land in which
all dreams of fame and empire were hammered out,
and nothing left possible save an empire of spiritual
power and the fame of a unique religion. A people
strangely proud and passionately exclusive, they
could never rest under the dominion of their great
neighbours, however light the burden imposed; and
since sustained resistance was out of the question
by reason of their inferior numbers and lack of
military power, they resorted to irritating acts of
rebellion, or intrigued with the enemies of their overlords,
and so brought down on their land frequent
vengeance. Such was their untameable nature that
the only practical policy open to Babylon, if she
wished to insure the loyalty, or at least, the neutrality
of Palestine, was to deport the Jews bodily to where
they could be under observation.</p>

<p>So we find the greatest heroes of Jewish history&mdash;from
Moses, through Gideon and Samson, to David and
Judas Maccabæus&mdash;are those who deliver the nation
from oppression; while Israel's prayers are largely cries
for succour against enemies, or for Divine vengeance on
the oppressor; only too eloquent a witness of the sense
of their own impotence. Yet it was precisely this experience
that forced their religion to rise above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
common type, to conquer its natural tendencies, and to
become the most magnificent faith in God that the
world has seen. Of this they themselves were not
ignorant; for one of their writers points to the easy lot
of Moab as the cause of their irreligion (Jer. xlviii. 11),
and one of the Psalmists says that it is the men
who have no changes who fear not God (lv. 19).
We need not consider the utterly feeble objection
that all this makes the religion of Israel the outcome
of natural necessity, rather than of Divine
revelation; for God made the land that made
Israel.</p>

<p>The entry into Canaan was therefore one of the
most critical periods in the history of this people and
in the development of the religion of the Old Testament.
It is, however, extremely difficult to discover
from the means at our disposal just how or when that
entry was effected. The sources for this period are
found in the Books of Joshua and Judges, but, from
comparison with much in the history that follows, it
is clear that they do not present us with absolute
history; yet a critical examination of these books
enables us to recover the essential facts.</p>

<p>A study of the preface to this lecture will show
that the story of the Conquest is obscure in its details
and difficult to reconcile with modern discoveries.
A careful examination of our sources shows that the
description of the entry of the Hebrews into Canaan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
as a "conquest," which was settled by a few decisive
battles, is at least rather fanciful; and as a matter
of fact we have quite another picture in the first
chapter of Judges, which partakes more of the
character of an "alien immigration," a method of
"conquest" in which the Jews have always been
remarkably successful. The history in Joshua
certainly represents the Conquest as striking, complete,
and followed by a ruthless extermination
of the defenders of their native land. In view
of the relations that were for long maintained
between the Canaanites and the Hebrews, the representation
in Judges i. must be regarded as nearer
to the facts than the story of the Conquest according
to the Book of Joshua. The children of Israel dwelt
side by side with the Canaanites, simply because
they were not able to drive them out; and as a
result the tribes were frequently divided by strong
belts of Canaanitish territory. Right through the
time of the Judges we get warfare between the
Israelites and the inhabitants of the land; sometimes
in pitched battles between the Canaanites and the
united tribes of Israel (Judges iv. v.), but more generally
in guerilla warfare or in the sudden surprise of a
Canaanitish garrison (Judges xviii.). The result of the
conflict seems to have been the gradual absorption
of the two elements into one nation. The records
definitely admit that it was not until the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
David that the Jebusites were driven from Jerusalem
(2 Sam. v. 6, 7), and not until Solomon that the
superiority of the Israelites was finally established
(1 Kings ix. 20, 21). It surely is an immense relief
to think that the huge slaughters recorded in the
Book of Joshua are, to say the least, exaggerations.</p>

<p>The history in Judges also clearly shows that there
was little cohesion between the tribes. They filtered
across the Jordan only by degrees, and there is
evidence that this process may have extended over
a considerable time. We have records of quarrels
between Gideon and Ephraim (Judges viii. 1), and
between Jephthah and Ephraim (Judges xii. 1). These
inter-tribal conflicts might have been serious, were it
not for the circumstance that the Israelites were no
sooner settled in the land than other tribes of desert
invaders began to press upon them, and they had to
sink family differences in order to combine against
the common enemy.</p>

<p>The song of Deborah (Judges v.) is one of the most
valuable documents we possess for the light which it
throws on the conditions of religious and national
life in this period, for it is probably the only
document in the Old Testament, earlier than the
founding of the monarchy, that is contemporary
with the events it describes. It shows that the tribes
had somewhat improved their position, for they now
seem to be in possession of the highlands of Ephraim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
although the plains are still in the hands of the
Canaanites. The growing power of the Israelites
and their threatening predominance moved the
Canaanites to a united effort to repress Israel. It is
to face this danger that the Prophetess Deborah calls
the tribes; but from the way in which the praise and
blame is meted out we can see that a strong sense of
national unity was still lacking. The important
point to be noticed is that the bond of unity to which
Deborah could appeal was the name of Jehovah. It
should be noted also that in the enumeration of the
tribes, Judah, Simeon, and Levi are altogether
omitted. In the case of so important a tribe as
Judah this is significant, for it agrees with the fact
that until the time of David this tribe does not come
into prominence. It has been conjectured that
Judah was only a small tribe, and may have
invaded Canaan from the south, for it is difficult
to conceive how it could have crossed the strong
Canaanitish territory which separated it from the
other tribes. At any rate, at this time it was not
regarded as one of the tribes of Israel; it may have
been that this tribe embraced a strong Canaanitish
element (Gen. xxxviii.), and this fact may have contributed
to the resentment which broke out among
the other tribes when Judah assumed the hegemony
in the time of David, and which led in the end to the
disruption of the Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
In our sources the history of this period has
attached to it a religious interpretation: apostasy,
and disobedience to the commands of Jehovah
were the causes of the people being sold into
the power of their enemies; when they returned
to the worship of Jehovah and penitently pleaded
for His forgiveness then deliverers were raised
up who vanquished their oppressors. This can be
nothing but a late interpretation, for the religion
of the Book of Judges is of quite a fixed order,
and many of the stories recorded in it will not lend
themselves to any such interpretation. The hand
that supplied this reading of the history of this
period has been identified with the author of Deuteronomy,
or, as some would prefer to say, with the
school of thought that produced that work. There
is a religious lesson in this history, as in all history;
but it is hardly to be found in a series of apostasies and
returns. There are really four separate endeavours
to account for the undoubted fact of the Canaanites
being spared. (1) Israel was not able to drive them
out (Judges i. 19, 27). (2) Israel was only commanded
to drive them out by degrees, "lest the beasts of the
field increase upon thee" (Deut. vii. 22). (3) It was
a providential arrangement to keep the Israelites
practised in war (Judges iii. 1, 2). (4) It was due to
direct disobedience to the command of Jehovah
(Judges ii. 20).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
The history does not entitle us to assume that the
judges were officials who exercised kingly rights over
a united Israel. The word translated "Judge" more
often means "Deliverer," and this is certainly the
part that they play. Of some of the so-called minor
judges we know nothing beyond their names, and
there is evidence that they have simply been used to
fill out a traditional period of 480 years (1 Kings
vi. 1). Whenever the "Judges" assumed kingly
or judicial functions trouble and rebellion always
followed. The figure of Samson displays little
fitness for ruling a nation or guiding it in religion,
but the stones of his life are illuminating for the
understanding of the morality and interests of
that age.</p>

<p>With this revised conception of the history of the
Conquest, and of the events which followed, we
are in a better position to estimate the effect of the
change from nomadic life to a settled existence, and
to understand how critical for the future of the
religion of Jehovah this change was.</p>

<p>We see tribes possessing little national unity, but
bound together by a religion in which lay the germ
of a mighty future, entering a land where the inhabitants
had reached a higher stage of civilisation, and
possessed a religion that drew its power from the
fact that it was the worship of Baal, the possessor
and owner of the land. In face of these conditions it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
was almost inevitable that many of the customs of
the original inhabitants should be gradually adopted,
and that the religion of Jehovah should borrow something
from the religion indigenous to the land. This
was certainly the result which followed. For a considerable
period we find a religion prevalent among
the common people, which is simply a conflation of
the two religions. There were certain elements
common to both, and certain advantages in the one,
together with corresponding weaknesses in the other,
that prepared the way for this syncretism.</p>

<p>We shall now turn to examine the religion of the
Canaanites, which we shall find to partake largely
of the common elements of Semitic religion. Their
deities were personifications of natural forces, and
among these there is no one which is supreme, and
nothing that tends to Monotheism. The gods are
friendly and destructive by turn, and of unreliable
character. It is nothing more than an undeveloped
Polytheism. The religion, as it is seen in the Old
Testament, groups itself around three names: Baal,
Ashtoreth (often written in plural form Ashtaroth),
and Molech (otherwise written Moloch, Milcom, and
known to the Phœnicians as Melkart).</p>

<p>The name of Baal has a hateful memory in the
pages of the Old Testament as the Canaanitish
deity to whom Israel constantly apostatised. The
exact significance of Baal in the Canaanitish religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
is a matter of dispute. He has been identified
with the sun, and by the Greeks with Zeus; so
that it has been inferred that Baal was the President
of the Canaanitish Pantheon. This view is no longer
generally accepted, for it certainly fails to fit in with
the records of the cult preserved in the Old Testament.
The word "Baal" is not a proper name, but
signifies "the Possessor"; it is used in Semitic
language for "husband," as the possessor of the wife,
and is used as the name for deity, as the possessor
of the land. Every land, and indeed every locality,
will therefore have its own Baal; so that in the Old
Testament we hear of the "Baalim" (the Hebrew
plural), and these local Baalim are further distinguished
by the addition of the name of their
locality or of some event with which they were
connected, as Baal-Peor, Baal-Berith, Baal-Zebul.
The "Baal" is especially responsible for sending rain
and sunshine, and for giving fruitful seasons. He is,
therefore, the god of agriculture, and the great events
of the agricultural year, such as harvest and vintage,
are observed as his festivals. It is natural to find the
uncertainty of the weather reflected in the character
of the Baalim, with the result that we get a religion
alternating between intoxicating joy and the deepest
gloom. To appease the fickle god or to win his favour
sacrifices, even of human lives, are presented, and
if Baal continues unheeding, scenes of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
unrestrained fanaticism prevail. It is this gloomy
religion which darkens the times of the later Kings
of Judah.</p>

<p>The Canaanitish Baal should be distinguished from
the Baal of Tyre (Melkart) whose worship was introduced
by Ahab. Here the introduction of an alien
Baal, with probably different rites and ceremonies,
awoke the resentment of the prophetic party under
the leadership of Elijah, but the worship of the
Canaanite Baal was maintained for long unchecked.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the worship of the Baalim
we find the worship of the Ashtaroth (Judges ii. 13).
The pronunciation of this word is obscure; it was
probably <i>Ashtart</i>, and the singular form, Ashtoreth
(1 Kings xi. 5), has been formed by inserting the
vowels of the word <i>bosheth</i> (shame), a common
device in the Old Testament for expressing contempt.
Ashtart is the female counterpart of Baal,
and is spoken of in the plural for a similar reason.
Monuments of the worship of Ashtart are still to be
found, and from these it is evident that we have here
the worship of the goddess of sexual passion, as
common in polytheistic systems, and best known in
the Greek worship of Aphrodite. The whole conception
of Ashtart can be traced to the famous
goddess <i>Ishtar</i> of Babylonian religion, and there is
only too certain evidence that in Canaan as elsewhere
the degrading rite of religious prostitution was used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
in this worship of female divinity (Hosea iv. 13). The
identification of Ashtart with the "Queen of Heaven"
(Jer. vii. 18; xliv. 15&ndash;25) is not so certain. As far as
the worship of the latter is described to us, it looks like
an importation of the Babylonian worship of Ishtar,
who was identified with the planet Venus or sometimes
with the moon. The "cakes to pourtray her"
(Jer. xliv. 19) may have been crescent-shaped cakes.</p>

<p>Of a similar character was the worship that
gathered around the name of Molech. We have
here simply the word for king (<i>Milk</i>) with the vowels
of <i>bosheth</i>. Of this name, Moloch, Milcom, and
Melkart of Tyre are variations. Molech is not
to be distinguished from Baal, as may be seen
from Jer. xix. 5, where the practice of passing children
through the fire, which was certainly connected
with the worship of Molech, is a part of the worship
of Baal. This burnt-sacrifice of children evidently
belonged to the Canaanitish religion (2 Kings xvi. 3).</p>

<p>This then was the religion of the Canaanites: in
times of prosperity and fruitful seasons, one of
rejoicing and festivity; but in time of famine, drought
or national danger, one of the most hopeless gloom
and of the most fearful fanaticism. In conflict with
this religion, the purer worship of Jehovah yet
presented certain weaknesses; these are found chiefly
in points of possible identification, which in the
course of the history actually took place. This may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
be difficult for us to understand until we remember
that Baal and Molech, to Semitic ears, simply meant
"Lord" and "King"; and Jehovah was the "Lord"
and "King" of Israel. If the character of Jehovah
was not clearly apprehended as moral by the common
people, we can see how easy it was for confusion to
take place.</p>

<p>The great weakness of the religion of Jehovah was
that He was not the God of Canaan. His home was
in distant Sinai, and the only symbol of His presence
was the ark, a symbol bound up with the idea of
war. As the people settled down to a peaceful
agricultural life, the need for Jehovah, the warrior
God, would not be keenly felt. There was certainly
a party from the very first who recognised the difference
between Jehovah and Baal and fought against
their identification, but so long as Baal was believed
to be a real being the danger of his secret worship at
least was never far away. Every land had its own
god, and although the people knew that Jehovah was
their God, yet they might think it necessary, and not
inconsistent, to pay their respects to the local Baalim
on whom they were dependent for the fruits of the
earth (Hosea ii. 8). Nothing therefore but a national
calamity could revive the old religion in face of the
attractions of the new; if peace had been continuous
it is hard to see how the religion founded by Moses
could have persevered. Such dangerous peace the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Children of Israel were not to enjoy. We soon hear
the rousing call to the help of Jehovah in the Song
of Deborah, and it was the threatened domination
by the Philistines that called the monarchy into
existence and revived the religion of Jehovah.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, a process of syncretism was
gradually taking place, which it was to be the task
of the Prophets to unravel; and how far it had gone
may be seen from the difficulty they found in making
the character of Jehovah and the moral demand
made upon His worshippers clear to the people.
"Jehovah," it must be remembered, was a name
largely personal. Baal was a general name for deity,
and could be applied to Jehovah quite truthfully.
That this actually took place may be seen from a
number of passages in the Old Testament. The most
instructive instance is to be found in Hosea ii. 16;
but the names given to places point in the same
direction: David calls the spot where Jehovah broke
his enemies, Baal-perazim; the same god is called
indiscriminately, Baal-berith (Judges viii. 33; ix. 4)
and El-berith (Judges ix. 46). This practice accounts
for the names of Saul's son, Eshbaal, and of Jonathan's
son, Meribbaal (1 Chron. viii. 33, 34), both of which
have been altered in the Book of Samuel to
"bosheth." (In obedience to the command of
Exod. xxiii. 13, <i>Bosheth</i> was substituted for <i>Baal</i> in
reading the Scriptures. The written text was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
altered in many places at a later period; the
Chronicler must have found <i>Baal</i> in his text of
Samuel; that is about 200 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) The names of
Jehovah and Baal therefore came to have the same
significance, and the distinction began to be missed;
Jehovah was still the God of Israel, but the moral
elements of His religion were gradually diluted with
the naturalistic conceptions of the worship of Baal.
Jehovah becomes the Baal of the land; that is, the
relation between Him and Israel is conceived in
a natural and even physical way. It is therefore no
longer a covenant relation, which depends on the
observance of moral obligations, but one of nature
which cannot be broken by either party. Naturally
the sanctuaries of the Canaanites are taken over by
the Israelites, and Jehovah is worshipped in "the
high places." All through the history worship at
these local sanctuaries is condemned, but only from
a later standpoint, for the earliest Book of Laws
permitted an altar to be erected anywhere where
Jehovah had manifested Himself (Exod. xx. 24).
Around some of these undoubtedly Canaanitish sanctuaries
the stories of the Patriarchs gathered, but
from the practices which prevailed at such places as
Bethel we can see that heathen rites were used, for
here Jeroboam set up the golden calves, which seem
to have been used in the worship of Jehovah, for
neither Elijah nor Amos condemns them. Jehovah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
is now worshipped all over the land, but there is
the same tendency to regard each separate place as
having its local deity, and so Jehovah is multiplied
(perhaps, Jer. xi. 13) and needs to be further identified
by the addition of place names, as in the
strange name El-bethel (Gen. xxxv. 7), El-elohe-Israel
(Gen. xxxiii. 20), in a way that is very like the
multiplication of the Baalim. So deeply was the
worship of Jehovah mixed up with Canaanitish ideas
that in the reign of Josiah the only possibility of
reform lay in forbidding the worship at the local
sanctuaries altogether and concentrating all worship
at the central sanctuary of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Nothing but this process of syncretism can explain
the condition of religion in the subsequent history,
and it is needed to enable us to understand both the
difficulty of the work of the Prophets and the form
their message takes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there must have been from the earliest
times elements that made for a purer faith, and
that never acquiesced in this confusion between
Jehovah and Baal, which certainly prevailed in the
popular mind; otherwise the Reformation of the
Eighth Century would be an isolated and inexplicable
movement, and without that historical support
the Prophets claimed. There was a party against
Baal altogether, although they do not emerge until
the monarchy. This party may have consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the "priests" of Jehovah. At mention of these we
must not think of the sacrificing priests described in
the Book of Leviticus. No such persons are known
until after the exile; during this period anyone could
sacrifice. The story of the priest in Judges xvii. gives
a good idea of this class; his chief duties seem to
have consisted in keeping the oracle and obtaining
decisions by the lot. These decisions became the
basis on which there was gradually built up the <i>Torah</i>
(the Law), which, as the word implies, was a collection
of decisions obtained by casting lots. For the
purpose of obtaining these decisions the priests seem
to have used an idol of some kind; for this is the
most natural explanation of the Ephod and its use
in the early history. There would be different degrees
of intellectual and moral capacity found in the ranks
of the priests, and many of them may have had
higher ideals of their duties than the one mentioned
in Judges. It would be likely that those who were in
charge of the Sacred Ark possessed a superior dignity
and maintained a purer tradition. Gradually the
magical accompaniments to their oracular decisions
may have given way to more judicial deliverances,
although in the time of David and Abiathar they
were apparently still used (1 Sam. xxx. 7). At any rate
the priests kept alive the idea of Jehovah as the dispenser
of justice, and helped to build up that system
of laws for which Israel is so justly famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
This "higher critical" view of the history is
simply one to which we are driven by the records
that stand nearest to the times they describe. It
certainly alters considerably the ordinary conceptions
of the type of religion that prevailed in those
early days, before the coming of the Prophets; but
that such was the type is only too clearly shown by
the writings of the Prophets themselves. Nevertheless
this view of the period, while it shuts out a
somewhat stiff and mechanical religious interpretation
of the history which has been forced upon it by a
later age, is still not without a valuable lesson,
which is perhaps not taught elsewhere in the Bible,
and yet is one that we need to have always before
us. It is one, the possibility of which always exists
and often threatens a spiritual religion: the danger of
a gradual encroachment and assimilation of pagan
ideas until the original purity is lost almost beyond
recovery. If this has happened anywhere it has
happened in Christianity. It was the awakening to
this paganisation of Christianity that provoked the
struggle of the Reformation, not yet decided.
Many of the conceptions that are still popularly
identified with Christianity are the remnants of
paganism. It is not necessary to enumerate the
common customs which wear only a thin veneer of
Christianity; but many of the ideas in connection
with Christian Doctrine certainly owe more to pagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
philosophy than they do to the New Testament.
The syncretism between Paganism and Christianity
has not been destroyed by the Reformation. Many
of the popular ideas of the Atonement, for instance,
rest on a pagan conception of God and a materialistic
idea of Christ's work which are so deeply involved
in the common presentation of Christianity that to
present the actual New Testament teaching would
seem to many like a denial of the foundation truths
of the Gospel. Still more dangerous is the localisation
of the god as the peculiar patron of the land,
which justifies many unholy wars and makes such a
thing as a national repentance almost impossible.
There is a god of the British Empire who is
remarkably like the Jehovah-Baal of the old syncretised
religion that ruled in the period which we have
been studying, and whose worship begets equal
indifference to the claims of true religion, and equally
cruel treatment for the prophet who strives to call
men to a purer faith.</p>

<p>It is a relief to turn to a more comforting lesson.
It is that which assures us that man's thought of God
is not entirely his own, that it cannot be destroyed
and is never wholly forgotten, but ever makes its way
to higher truth and greater power. The way in
which the higher religion comes is through the pure
minds of those who wish only to live up to the
fulness of the truth, and however mistaken they be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
wish only to know and to do the will of God. A
similar task lies equally before every honest man and
every true Christian. The lesson is plain: beware
of a stagnant religion that dreads progress, and
keep the mind open as a child's to God's further
revelation of Himself, which has yet many things to
tell us.</p>

<h2 id="lec5"><a name="PROPHETISM_EARLY_STAGES" id="PROPHETISM_EARLY_STAGES">PROPHETISM&mdash;EARLY STAGES</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The reader is recommended to investigate for himself the origins of
Prophetism by a careful examination of the following <span class="locked">passages:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I. There were originally Guilds or Schools of Prophets; from which it
would appear that Prophetism was a kind of profession (1 Sam. x. 5;
xix. 20; 2 Kings ii. 3, 5). There is nothing in the records that we
possess that marks these bands of prophets as possessed of great
spiritual power; they were devoted to the cause of Israel and Jehovah,
and the way in which this was manifested was taken to imply that they
were filled with the spirit of Jehovah; it inclines somewhat to the
Dervish order of enthusiastic devotion (1 Sam. x. 5; xix. 20&ndash;24). It
is significant that wherever these schools are found there is known to
have existed a "high place," <i>i.e.</i>, an old Canaanitish sanctuary, now
used for the worship of Jehovah-Baal. A similar order of prophets was
connected with the worship of the Tyrian Baal (1 Kings xviii.).</p>

<p>II. Samuel (1 Sam. xix. 20) Elisha (2 Kings ii. 15; iv. 38; vi. 1&ndash;7)
and in much less degree, Elijah (1 Kings xviii. 4; xix. 10) had some
connection with these schools.</p>

<p>III. The later Prophets did not claim descent from these guilds of
"prophecy," and even repudiated any connection with them (Amos
vii. 14). This conflict between the "called" prophet and the professionals
is revealed in the fierce denunciations of Isaiah (xxix. 10) and
Jeremiah (v. 31; xiv. 13, 14; xxvi. 7, 8).</p>

<p>IV. The identification of these prophets with priests and seers probably
gives a clue to their origin (1 Sam. ix. 9; Isa. xxix. 10; Jer.
xxvi. 7, 8; Amos vii. 12).</p>

<p>V. Certain individuals who are called prophets or seers had official
court connection (2 Sam. xxiv. 11; 1 Chron. xxv. 5; Amos vii. 10).</p>

<p>Between these "prophets" and the great writers who bear the same
designation, we cannot fail to recognise an immense difference; Samuel
and Elijah are connecting links between the two classes. Elijah is
rather a hero than a prophet in the later sense, for he gives us no new
doctrine, and Samuel is a seer who has risen to political power, rather
than a religious ruler. Critics have discovered evidence of a double
narrative in our documents.</p>

<p>(Later) 1 Sam. i. ii. iii. iv. vii. 3&ndash;17; viii. x. 17&ndash;25; xii. xv.</p>

<p>If these be examined and contrasted, it will be found that Samuel is
more allied in the earlier narratives with the "priest-seer" than with
the Prophet of the type of Amos. A confirmation of this double narrative
is found in the different accounts of the origin of the monarchy which
they give. Samuel, according to the earlier sources, is just the type we
need for the intermediate stage in the development of the Prophet.</p>

<p>For the different historical conceptions of the work and character of
David the narratives in Samuel should be compared with the representation
given in Chronicles, and with that inferred by the ascription
of various Psalms to his authorship.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">PROPHETISM&mdash;EARLY STAGES</span></h3>

<p>We have seen that in the time of the Judges the
religion of Jehovah became so mixed with elements
taken over from the Canaanites that the original
revelation gained through Moses was in danger of
being lost. We have now to trace the steps by which
this syncretism was broken up, and the advance
made to the purely monotheistic conception and
the lofty morality of the great literary Prophets.
However this came about it is certain that it was not
due to any gradual movement among the mass of
the people, for the type of religion which we have
been considering remains largely unaltered in
its hold upon the popular mind. Through the
teaching of the earlier prophets certain reforms were
attempted, but none of them seem to have touched
the heart of the nation. Hezekiah and Josiah
attempted to reform religion by centralising the
national worship, but, from whatever cause, it left
the people still in opposition to the prophetic type
of religion, a conflict that was only ended by
the calamity of the exile. It is, therefore, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
prophetic band themselves that we must turn. Can
we trace within this more limited circle a movement
that shall in any way prepare us for the appearance
of men of the type of Amos?</p>

<p>To answer this question we must turn to the Books
of Samuel and Kings. These present us with a
history of the period which, like most history, has
been written, or over-written, from a later standpoint
and made to conform with later ideals. On the whole,
however, and by contrasting it with the still later
conceptions of the Books of Chronicles, we can form
an accurate impression of the state of religion at this
time; and incidentally we have a valuable account of
a movement that evidently gave birth to those great
conceptions of religion which were to be voiced with
such power and force by the great Prophets. The
writers who, apart from the value of their religious
teaching, have by their distinctive style made the Old
Testament a contribution to the literature of the
world, are known to us as "Prophets." This name
they share, however, with others who have left us no
first-hand record of their religious opinions, and who,
as described to us in the early sources, bear only the
slightest resemblance to Prophets as we conceive
them. Our task will be, therefore, to investigate the
origins of this movement which embraces such
diverse elements, and this we may commence by
examining the meaning of the word "Prophet" (<i>Nabi</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Like many other words in the Old Testament
that lock up important secrets, the origin of the
word Prophet is obscure and its meaning disputed.
The conception which is most natural to our word
"Prophet" is of one who sees into the future; this is
not even the main characteristic of the writing
Prophets, nor does it embrace all the phenomena
connected with the movement, especially in its early
stages. All that can be said of the word from an
etymological standpoint is that it has no origin which
can be traced in historical Hebrew, and the inference
is that it is either a very ancient word, or one
borrowed from some other language. The word can,
however, hardly be ancient, for it is not common to
Semitic tongues, as is the word "priest," for instance,
while we have a definite statement that within historic
times it superseded the older word "seer"
(1 Sam. ix. 9). The name was also used for certain
devotees of the Tyrian Baal, whose worship was
imported by Ahab; but it can hardly be that the
name would be adopted directly from a phenomenon
that was so repugnant to the Israelites, although the
common name hints that there was a common
ancestry somewhere. It seems fair to assume from
the facts mentioned that the word is, at least, not
older than the entry into Canaan, and while it cannot
be definitely proved that it was borrowed from the
Canaanites, there is some confirmation of this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the fact that the earliest occurrence of the name
is in connection with the "sons of the prophets," who
are always found in places where it is known that
there were Canaanitish sanctuaries.</p>

<p>The word <i>Nabi</i> has been variously connected with
the root, <i>nab'a</i>, "to bubble," and so one inspired;
with the Arabic word, "to speak," and so a speaker
or herald. The word seems to exist in Assyrian in
the form <i>nabu</i>, "to announce," but this is probably
from the name of the Babylonian deity, Nebo, the
God of Eloquence, so that the word might mean one
possessed by Nebo. Some have even looked to this
as the ultimate derivation of the word. The investigation
of the word really gives nothing satisfactory, and
we must therefore turn to examine the character
of the persons to whom it was applied.</p>

<p>In various passages in the Old Testament, Seer
and Prophet are so used as to lead us to infer that
they embraced identical ideas (Isa. xxix. 10; Amos
vii. 12), and in one passage, which has only the
authority of a late annotation of the text, we learn
that they were identical in their application (1 Sam.
ix. 9). The other name with which Prophet is frequently
bracketed is that of Priest; they are placed
together in the denunciations of Jeremiah (ii. 8;
v. 31). Our previous studies showed us that these
classes were all somewhat akin in their origins; the
duties of the priest were discharged in keeping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
oracles, while the Seer is evidently akin to the
Soothsayer, a type that has appeared in all religions.
We have a concrete example of these classes being
combined in Samuel. In the early story of Samuel's
first meeting with Saul, we find Saul turning to consult
the famous Seer in order to discover where
his father's lost asses are to be found; and even the
question of the Seer's usual fee is mentioned (1 Sam.
ix. 8). This picture, which makes Samuel a notable
Seer, is earlier and more authentic than that which
makes him nearly a ruler over Israel. Although he
is nowhere called a priest, yet he himself sacrifices,
and his presence at a sacrifice is reckoned an advantage
(1 Sam. xiii. 8&ndash;13); while we have the story of
his sleeping by the ark in his youth. The Seer is,
therefore, an exalted type of priest who has obtained
renown by the success of his prognostications, and so
we read of Seers attached to the courts of the Kings
(2 Sam. xxiv. 11; 1 Chron. xxv. 5); but the later
sources have recognised that there is something
heathenish about the word, and have covered it up
with the name Prophet. From the early descriptions
of the bands of prophets in the books of Samuel, it
would seem that they are more allied to the priestly
order than to the Seers, for it is certain that down to
the middle of the Ninth Century the name Prophet
stands for something different from its use as applied
to Moses and the literary Prophets. The name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
applied to bands of men who "prophesy," but this
prophesying is entirely unlike the methods associated
by us with the prophetic spirit. It is evidently something
which is done, not individually, but in companies,
and apparently in solemn procession to the
accompaniment of noisy music. It must have been
a species of violent incantation, leading to acts of
fierce fanaticism, in which the clothing might be
stripped off, and often ending in complete mental
prostration (1 Sam. x. 5, 6; xix. 23, 24). The
connection of music with religious exercises is
almost universal, and it always had a conspicuous
place in the worship of Jehovah (2 Sam. vi. 5;
Isa. xxx. 29), while music has often been used to
induce the prophetic vision (2 Kings iii. 15). These
prophets seem to have lived together in schools,
semi-monastic orders, or guilds, and to have been
found where there were high places, or Canaanitish
sanctuaries; and from their behaviour we are forced
to admit that we have here a common manifestation
in the history of religion, where companies of men
devote themselves to fanatical outbursts that are taken
to indicate possession by the Spirit of God. To the
accompaniment of music and frenzied dancing they
work themselves into a state that approaches madness&mdash;always
among uncivilised peoples taken to
be a sign of the hand of God (Hosea ix. 7). We
cannot fail to be reminded of the greater excesses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the prophets of Baal, the extraordinary performances
of the dervish bands, and the fanatical excesses
that have always disfigured monastic institutions.</p>

<p>It cannot be dismissed, therefore, as incredible that
this phenomenon was derived from the Canaanites, and
developed a zeal for Jehovah that was manifested after
a fashion common to the devotees of other religions.</p>

<p>Down to a very late date in the history of the
Kingdom, the literary Prophets found themselves in
conflict with bands of prophets, who to their judgment
prophesied falsely; and from the way in which
these are often associated with the priests, it seems probable
that they represent the deteriorated&mdash;or perhaps
simply the stagnant&mdash;remnant of this earlier movement.
It is, however, necessary to assume that even in
the earlier movement there were purer elements than
those which we have noticed, and that it embraced
individuals who were led into a real fellowship with
the mind of God, of which Samuel and Elisha are
conspicuous examples. Religious movements of the
"revival" type, which have undoubtedly inspired
and produced great ethical changes and resulted
finally in sane religion, have often been accompanied
in their earlier stages by these frenzied
outbreaks. It would be in response to some of those
strange mental movements which modern psychology
is endeavouring to understand, but also whenever
danger threatened the nation or the national religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
that these enthusiasts would take the field. As
the movement shed its purely hysterical elements,
it may have been occupied in the compilation of the
records of Israel's history, for many of these hardly
reflect the higher prophetic standpoint, or in writing
down such stories of their great heroes as we find
connected with Elijah and Elisha. A connection
with the literary productions of the great Prophets
may be thus indirectly traced, as it also most certainly
can in the prophetic <i>style</i>, which in its fierce rhythm
of denunciation or its sobbing sweeps of passionate
appeal recalls something of the incantation of the
prophetic bands. Samuel, Elijah and Elisha, by
their connection with this early phenomenon of
prophetism and by the approximation of their work
to the ideals of the later Prophets, are the true links
between the earlier and later stages of the prophetic
movement. It is both credible and natural that,
when the movement had spent itself in some wonderful
advance into ethical power and religious insight,
the less noble elements should have still remained
and continued to claim divine inspiration, and yet
have been found in open conflict with its own nobler
productions.</p>

<p>It would seem that the obscure sect known as
Nazarites were connected in some way with the early
prophetic movement, for they are mentioned side by
side with the prophets (Amos ii. 11, 12); and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
probable that Samuel was both a Nazarite and a
prophet (1 Sam. i. 11), while Samson, in whom the
Spirit of Jehovah seemed to produce these strange
outbursts of savage frenzy, was certainly a Nazarite
(Judges xiii. 4, 5, 7, 14). It would appear that the
Nazarites were men who devoted themselves to the
service of Jehovah under certain vows of abstinence
from wine and ceremonial defilement. The vows
might be taken for life or for a limited period, but
while under the vow the hair was left unshorn.
There is evidence that this is an old Semitic custom,
and that when the vow was accomplished the hair
was made an offering to the god (Num. vi. 18); to
this day the pilgrims to Mecca are forbidden to cut
their hair until the journey is completed. The law
of the Nazarites (Num. vi.) is only a late attempt to
legislate for a custom that had existed independently
of the institutions of the religion of Jehovah, and so to
secure a place within the official religion for a custom
that would have been difficult to suppress by prohibition.
Similar in many respects to the Nazarites,
but even more obscure, were the Rechabites, who
abstained from wine (Jer. xxxv. 2&ndash;10), but who seem
also to have protested against the adoption of any of
the arts and customs of settled life, especially as these
customs were typified in the cultivation of the vine.
They chose these methods in order to resist the
influence of Canaan, which was threatening so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
dangerously the integrity of the nation and the national
religion. They probably hoped by these conservative
manners to destroy the syncretism between Baal and
Jehovah; for the only other mention of the sect in the
Old Testament is in connection with the extirpation
of the house of Ahab (2 Kings x. 15&ndash;17).</p>

<p>It may appear repulsive to those who have made
up their minds as to the methods by which the Spirit
of God can work to trace back the supreme genius,
the impassioned ethical ideals, and the practical statesmanship
of the great Prophets of Israel to movements
bordering on insanity; yet it is from enthusiasm
that most of the great saving movements of the
world have come. Certainly the great religious
revival which was soon to come in Israel owed
almost as much of its success to these bands of
enthusiasts as to the personality of Elijah.</p>

<p>It falls now to our task to trace the movement
from bands to individuals, from Prophetism to
Prophecy, from a phenomenon to a teaching. We
have records of men who seem to have moved beyond
the mantic stage and who prepare the way for the
great Prophets. We can conveniently call these
"transition prophets." We shall find that they bear
some resemblance to the old style of Seer, or to
the guild prophets, or to both. Of some of these we
have only the merest mention, so that they may be
called the <i>minor</i> transition prophets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Two stand together by their connection with David
and from the fact that they both seem to have been
Court officials (2 Sam. vii. 2; xxiv. 11; 1 Kings i. 10).
There is no word here of the mantic fury of the early
prophets; although in Gad, who makes known the
best way to escape the anger of an offended Deity,
we have a survival of the ancient seer; but in Nathan
we have a truly noble example of one who, although
he may have been dependent on David for his daily
bread, yet faced him with the unsparing denunciation
of his sin. Here is a man who regards right in Israel
more than the smile of princes, and who has a higher
conception of his office than that of a convenient
manipulator of oracles for the flattering of a King.
Nathan is a true ancestor of Amos and Jeremiah.</p>

<p>Ahijah the Shilonite is famous because he foretold
the disruption of the Kingdom (1 Kings xi. 29&ndash;31),
and we may see in this the beginnings of that political
judgment which was to become notable in the later
Prophets; although a partisan motive might be
suspected in this particular case, when Jeroboam,
in later years, sent his wife to consult Ahijah, accompanied
with the usual fee (1 Kings xiv. 2), the message
he received shows that in Ahijah we have no party
politician, but the impartial judgment of the later
Prophets.</p>

<p>There is a pathetic and somewhat mysterious
story of an unnamed man of God who delivered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
word of Jehovah to Jeroboam at the altar at Bethel,
and who, refusing the accustomed hospitality due to
a prophet, afterwards accepted the invitation of the
old prophet of Bethel, and paid the penalty with
his death. We have here a story, the moral of which
may be obscure enough, but which certainly illustrates
the growing conflict between the two prophetic ideals.
Here is a prophet who travels from his own land to
rebuke the sin of a King to his face, afterwards yielding
to the blandishments of one of the official prophets.
The new Prophetism, tempted from its superior
position by the old, fell; yet not many years were to
elapse before these two orders, in the persons of Amos
and Amaziah, were again to face one another at this
same spot, and this time the new Prophetism was to
maintain its integrity (1 Kings viii.; Amos vii. 10&ndash;17).</p>

<p>Before we pass on to the <i>major</i> transition prophets,
it will be well to consider here the effect which the
foundation of the Monarchy had on the development
of the religion of Israel.</p>

<p>Of the inauguration of the Monarchy we possess
two accounts; one extremely unfavourable, written
doubtless after Judah's experience of some of her
notorious Kings, and in the light of a somewhat
ideal conception of the Theocratic government that
was supposed to have flourished before the time of
Saul (1 Sam. x. 17&ndash;24); the other account, in
which Samuel himself at the revelation of Jehovah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
initiates the movement towards the Monarchy
(1 Sam. ix. 15&ndash;x. 1) by anointing Saul, is the one
that is placed earlier by the critics. The Monarchy
was an inevitable stage in the social development of
a settled people, and it was the policy of Samuel to
make the Monarchy the organ of the Theocracy.
For all this Saul does not seem to have had any
influence on religion, or to have ever realised the
needs of his times, and under the sense of failure he
became a prey to fear and depressing influences which
eventually wrecked his reason.</p>

<p>Round the name of David have gathered the
national ideals of heroism and sainthood so often
found in combination in early story. They had a
true origin in David, if we judge from the standards
of piety and rulership that were natural to his age.
Outlaw, hero, poet, saint&mdash;David is the darling of
Israel's history. It would be unfair to David to
picture him as the saintly author of some of the
tender Psalms that bear his name, although others
of a more robust character might well be from his
hand. That David was a poet seems to be certain,
and the songs of lament over Saul and Abner, which
have strong claims to be genuine, bear witness to his
true poetic gift; but they are deficient in any display
of deep religious feeling. We may have also to
reduce somewhat the conception of the extent or the
absoluteness of his kingly rule. He was rather one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of those freebooters who by their heroism and rough
manly courage are able to gather round them men of
their own nature and to inspire in their followers a
loyal devotion. To this pleasant adventurer the early
Kingdom fell, but for long it was only a kingdom of
personal followers; nor does he ever seem to have
been enthusiastically acknowledged by the whole
nation, or to have established his claims absolutely
beyond dispute. His heroic defence against the
Philistine invasion was sufficient to give him a great
place in the affection of the people, yet he never
assumed the imperial rule in the manner of his
successor Solomon. With all this necessary allowance
for the idealising process of a later age, David
was the indispensable centre round which the early
ideals and legends of the Monarchy could collect.
His work was of immense importance for the future;
especially his conquest of Jerusalem, now for the
first time wrested from the Canaanites and destined
to become in the future the centre of the national life,
to be bound up with his name, and above all to be
the peculiar dwelling-place of Jehovah. To make
Jerusalem his capital was a very diplomatic stroke, for
it was neutral territory to both Ephraim and Judah,
and this fact quietened the mutual jealousy of
these tribes. It was also a great work of David
that by his rough piety he definitely connected the
Kingship with devotion to the cause of Jehovah. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
devotion found expression in his care for the sacred
palladium of the Tribes, although it was policy as well
as piety that brought the Ark to Jerusalem; for we are
forced to admit that in matters of religion David was
not greatly in advance of his times. He regarded
the jurisdiction of Jehovah as not extending beyond
Palestine (1 Sam. xxvi. 19), and although he himself
may have abandoned idols, yet he allowed them in
his house (1 Sam. xix. 13), while he retained the old
custom of consulting the will of Jehovah by the
Ephod (1 Sam. xxx. 7) or by the movements of trees
(2 Sam. v. 23&ndash;25). His conception of Jehovah was
that of a Being of uncertain temper, who would
take vengeance for any acts of ceremonial violation
(2 Sam. vi. 9) or whose anger might be aroused
for reasons beyond human discovery (2 Sam. xxiv.
10&ndash;17).</p>

<p>But it would be equally wrong to blame David
because he does not come up to the ideals of a later
age. So far as it went, we may believe that his piety
was real; he was a man after Jehovah's own heart,
<i>for those times</i>. He certainly did his best to found a
Kingdom on personal affection and to establish some
kind of impartial justice. In the matter of Bathsheba
and Uriah David has been judged by impossible
standards, and especially by the religious ideas of the
51st Psalm, which bears in its every line evidence of a
morality far too deep for the age of David, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
is quite unsuitable for a confession of murder and
adultery. It was no crime in the eyes of an oriental
monarch to take his neighbour's wife, and it was
novel doctrine that David heard from the lips of
Nathan; it is to be laid to his everlasting credit
that he listened to this prophetic judgment, was
convicted of the sinfulness of his act, and repented
very profoundly.</p>

<p>When we pass to Solomon we come to a character
altogether different, but one that is very difficult to
estimate from the portrait presented to us in the Old
Testament. The writers allow themselves to be
carried away by the tradition of his magnificence,
and by the external evidence of his piety preserved
in the splendid Temple which he reared to the glory
of Jehovah; but they cannot produce much evidence
for the depth of his personal religion. He attempted
to build an empire on the lines of the barbaric and
superficial glories of his greatest neighbours; but
its splendour and certainly its significance have been
rather overdrawn by the later historians. It was a
reign of splendour, but for the religion of Israel it
was unimportant, for it was in the main irreligious.
Save for the presence of Nathan at his coronation,
the prophetic ministry almost disappears in this
reign; what prophets remain are opposed to his
policy. Solomon was little more than a worldly cosmopolitan;
his empire was magnificent in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
with the achievements of his predecessors, but it
rested not as David's on the devotion of the people
to a popular hero, but depended for its strength
on a system of taxation and a false imperialism:
forced labour was employed and the loyalty of the
tribes was strained. It was an endeavour to change
the government from a natural and tribal system to
that of an Eastern despotism; and it ended in failure.
The building of the Temple was only a part of this
policy, and it was a policy resented by the prophetic
party, who were all for simplicity in matters of
worship (2 Sam. vii.; omit verse 13). The Temple
did not occupy too outstanding a place in the block
of royal buildings, and there is no evidence that in
this age it was anything more than Solomon's
private chapel built with the desire to rival the
splendid royal shrines of other countries. It was
evidently designed largely on heathen models, and
contained heathen symbols which the later religion
absorbed with difficulty. The adoption of the Temple
as the supreme centre of Israel's worship was not the
work of Solomon, but the effect of the teaching of
Isaiah of Jerusalem and the consequence of the
reforms of Hezekiah and Josiah. The harem and
the strange worship were similarly parts of an international
policy. Solomon was certainly the first to
give to the worship of Jehovah an imposing splendour
and regularity, but it was not a splendour that appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
to the Prophets. The beautiful prayer of the dedication
can hardly be the composition of Solomon, but
is more likely to have been the production of a later
age which endeavoured to give to this display a piety
which the original did not possess. In time the
Temple was to become of enormous importance, but
in this period it remained only a magnificent shrine
for the Ark. The fact that two of the prophets sided
with Jeroboam may point to a revolt against this
religious splendour. The bulls of Jeroboam were a
counterblast to the Temple, and although his name is
ever afterwards connected with the introduction of
this idolatrous worship, and the succeeding Kings of
Israel condemned for their participation, it is evident
that these strictures are somewhat intensified by the
conception that in the quarrel between Israel and
Judah, Judah was in the right, and by the refusal to
allow for the fact that this method of worship had
not been condemned by any contemporary. The
calves were most likely ancient symbols of Semitic
divinity, and were certainly intended as symbols of
Jehovah. Nevertheless, the future lay with the
Temple and the South, for the revolution was based
on a merely conservative impulse and contained no
ideal. In the South, Jehovah was never worshipped
with such an excess of heathen symbolism, and thither
the voice of Prophecy soon transferred itself to find
in Judah its greatest sphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
We are brought now to one of the most pregnant
movements of this time, known as the northern prophetic
revolt, and to the work and personalty of the
major transition prophets, Elijah and Elisha. The
introduction of the worship of the Tyrian Baal by
Ahab was the signal for revolt. Here was a violation
of the commonest conceptions of religion: the transplantation
of the worship of another god, Melkart, the
Baal of Tyre, into the territory of Jehovah, who was
regarded as the Baal of Canaan. It opened the eyes
of the schools of the Prophets to the danger of the
use of the name of Baal, and was the cause of its
complete disuse as a name for Jehovah (Hosea ii. 16,
17). In the revolt against the worship of this heathen
Baal there stands out as its chief inspiration and
leader the magnificent figure of the prophet Elijah.
It is evident that in the story of his life we have
much that is legendary and probably some confusion
with the work of Elisha, but the religious significance
is sufficiently clear. We have noticed that Elijah is
remotely connected with the prophetic schools, and
they share with him the persecution organised by the
devotees of Baal; the old mantic accompaniments of
prophecy are still found in Elijah; he seems to charm
the rain (1 Kings xviii. 42), and he certainly hears it
coming. With all his courage and insight he does
not fully comprehend the true methods by which the
religion of Jehovah is to win its way; conviction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
to be brought by thunder and fire; if these fail there
remains the sword. It may be difficult to decide
whether Elijah actually conceived the wonderful
revelation at Mount Horeb, but it is more than likely
that to this man there came in the hour of failure the
discovery that there were other ways more to the
mind of Jehovah whereby men should realise His
presence; a discovery which has been dramatised in
the theophany on Horeb. Revelation by the still
small voice of inner conviction certainly gained
greater recognition after the ministry of Elijah.</p>

<p>If we seek to understand the meaning of Elijah's
stand for Jehovah, we shall see that it was first of all
a protest against the syncretism of the Baal and
Jehovah religions. This protest may have been
founded initially on conceptions not too exalted,
namely, that Jehovah and Melkart could not be
worshipped in the same land, but there are evidences
that Elijah had advanced further than that. His
daring taunts to Baal amount to complete scepticism
as to his existence, or at least of his power to injure
the true follower of Jehovah. If that is so, then we
have in Elijah the first monotheist. He clearly
perceived that in character Baal and Jehovah were
utterly different. The cruelty connected with the
religion of Jehovah still persists under Elijah, but
the incompatibility between the true religion and
heathenism is recognised and affirmed. We may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
sum up Elijah's religion in his own phrase: "I have
been very jealous for Jehovah."</p>

<p>There is another aspect of Elijah's work which certainly
forms a true transition to the teaching of the
later Prophets; he denounces the murder of Naboth
almost as much as the worship of Baal. We trace
here the rise of the ethical conception of the service
of Jehovah and the protest against social wrongs
which was to become so great a part of the burden
of such men as Amos and Micah.</p>

<p>With Elijah we can see forming, however dimly,
the thought of a Kingdom of God, and the peculiar
patriotism of the Prophets: he desires an Israel
independent of all heathen alliances; it is a conception
of a Kingdom which shall be great in intension
rather than wide in extension. It was this conflict
of the prophetic and the so-called patriotic ideals
that was to contribute largely to the final overthrow
of the State. It may have been that the
Prophets could never have built up a strong State on
the lines they indicated, and their very protest may
have weakened the arm of statesmen and contributed
to the destruction of the Kingdom founded by David
and Solomon. We can only feel that we side with
the Prophets. If the prophetic voice had been
silenced we might have had Israel with a kingdom
as mighty as Assyria, although that is highly doubtful;
but it would have been a kingdom as useless for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
contribution to religion as that proud, vain, and cruel
empire.</p>

<p>The theophany at Horeb, therefore, whatever its
embellishment and however symbolical its dress, is
the true history of this period. In the development
of the prophetic religion, magic and mystery are failing,
display and external glory are passing away, and
there enters from this time the conception of the
religion of the inward voice on which the work of the
later Prophets is built. Elisha is but a pale reflection
of his master, and makes little contribution to
religion; but we soon hear of Micaiah (1 Kings xxii. 8),
whose message reveals the still widening gap between
the professional prophet and the new order of men
who hear with greater clearness the true voice of
Jehovah. But sixty years have to pass, and Northern
Palestine awakens to the echoes of a new voice,
and listens to the new message of the first of that
prophetic band who have enriched literature while
they have exalted religion&mdash;Amos the herdman of
Tekoa.</p>

<p>Where elsewhere in history has there been a
religion that, starting in comparative heathenism,
almost lost in conflict with a fully-developed paganism,
has yet moved steadily upward, breaking away from
its origins, shedding the false charms of magic and
sorcery, and rising by gradual ascent into fellowship
with the Will of God? It is this <i>movement</i> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
constitutes the inspiration of the Old Testament and
that makes it still a Word of God to us.</p>

<p>Many of these conclusions, which have been put
forward and established by critical methods, especially
in reference to the religious feeling of those times, and
in the different conception of the piety of men like
David and Solomon, may strike the reader as startling
and disturbing. That may well be, but that is no
excuse for our reading into Bible story more than
can be legitimately found there, while it will be sure
to obscure some of its highest teaching, which is to
be found not in isolated "texts," but in great movements.
It is the facts that we have to face, and
the facts are obscured not so much by the corrections
of the history by the later historians, as by our forcing
into them the still later conceptions of our own times.
We have not given detailed proof of many of the
positions here taken up; they may be sought in
detail by the reader in the works of Biblical scholarship.
Our object is to discover whether these things
being so, we can still find a true revelation in the
history of this people, and hear in it the Voice of
God. Do we not get from this corrected view of
the history, a sense of the splendid onward movement
of this religion, which in itself is so much more
inspiring than the monotonous conception, which is
only the product of later Judaism, that the history
of Israel's religion is nothing but a series of apostasies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
from a pure and perfect faith? That late conception
is not borne out by a careful and critical study of
the sources, and it rather owes its strength to-day
to a certain dogmatic conception of human nature
that is needlessly pessimistic, and to an idea of the
weakness of the Spirit of God in His dealings with
man that nearly approaches atheism.</p>

<p>One or two lessons of the period stand out in strong
relief. One is that better things come of enthusiasm,
even when it is mistaken, than from indifference.
The reference of all the institutions of Israel to the
definitely revealed Will of Jehovah may seem to
some, after these investigations, a mistake. This can
only arise from too narrow a conception of the working
of God and the means through which His Spirit
reaches man, for it is this very reference to the Will
of God that is responsible for the advance in Israel's
faith. To believe in the Will of God, and to refer all
to it, does gradually increase the knowledge of that
Will, and so leads to a true revelation.</p>

<p>Another lesson is, not to despise the accompaniments
of the first movements of the Spirit of God in
man. It is not within the scope of this work to
enquire why it is that when a man is moved by
the Spirit of God such strange phenomena as we
have been studying in the prophetic bands, which
still accompany many revivals, should be the immediate
results. There must be patience with these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
things as beginnings; but equally must there be
impatience with them when they elevate themselves
into a permanent claim to recognition as the only
signs of a true religious life, and when they refuse to
recognise as higher the sane and ethical movement
to which they themselves have given birth. One of
the chief difficulties in things religious is to recognise
the offspring of a great movement, to discover the
time when the child must be allowed its new-found
freedom, to know when symbols may be dropped and
the reality brought in. Protestantism has given
birth to wider thoughts about God and deeper
appreciations of the extent of His working, which are
the logical outcome of Protestantism, and yet which
are often repudiated by those whose Protestantism is
of the aggressive type. A progressive movement of
any kind always has these strifes. They are as constant
in Science as in Religion, only in Science they
are more easily overcome by the greater readiness to
accept new revelation. Christianity is a religion
that moves, and, as Christ Himself foretold, it causes
the son to rise up against his father, the new generation
to come into conflict with the old. Ours it is
never to forget that the Kingdom of God is on the
side of the child; except ye receive the Kingdom of
God as a child, in the spirit of enquiry and growth,
except ye never grow old, ye cannot enter therein.</p>

<p class="p1">Judging from the standard of New Testament religion and their contribution
to it, the Prophets may be roughly classified in the above
order. The higher tendency seems to vanish from the historical works
which were composed after the Exile, save in many of the Psalms, where
religion reaches its highest expression outside the New Testament. The
tendency represented by the middle and horizontal line ends in the
somewhat superficial ethics of such works as the Book of Proverbs.
The lower tendency <i>is only to be judged so from comparison</i>; it served
its purpose, and it was an honest endeavour to reduce the Prophetic
ideals to a definite system. It is in line with the spirit of many of the
Psalms that the religion of the revelation of Christ takes its rise, and
we may see in the Sadducees and the Pharisees the degenerate effect of
the other lines of development.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="vspace large"><a name="Lecture_VI" id="Lecture_VI">Lecture VI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE RELIGION OF THE LITERARY
PROPHETS</span></h3>

<p>Among the writings of the Old Testament, the
Prophetical Books, whether considered as literature
or religion, are acknowledged to stand out as unsurpassed.
If the Psalms claim to rival them it is to be
remembered that the Psalms are probably to be
traced to the Prophetic teaching. The Prophets
themselves begin a new era; they are creative
and owe but little to their past. That for so long a
period, in unbroken continuity, there should emerge
from a tiny nation a succession of men of differing
temperament, training, and social position, who
should with remarkable unity voice truths of religion
not only hitherto unrecognised but rarely surpassed
or apprehended in subsequent history, is in itself a
unique phenomenon in comparative religion. Equally
notable is the fact, that in the majority of the
Prophets we have not only the gift of religious
intuition, but that this is found in combination with
great oratorical power, true poetic genius, and practical
statesmanship. They remain for all time an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
indisputable witness to the Divine revelation in the
development of Israel's religion.</p>

<p>Previous stages which we have been able to recognise
in the development of Israel's religion do not
carry us on to Amos by so inevitable a movement,
that his message could be predicted as the next stage
to be reached. When we come fresh from the investigation
of the religion held by the leaders of the
people in the times of David and Solomon, we
recognise the immense strides made when we open
the Book of Amos. We can trace a likeness between
Elijah and Amos in their denunciation of wrong; but,
in the sphere of religion, there is a great gulf between
them which no records of the intervening period
quite help us to bridge over. We cannot think of
Amos taking part in the great vindication of Carmel;
it is probable that he would have recognised it as
useless. In Samuel, Elijah and Elisha we undoubtedly
have the religious ancestors of the Literary
Prophets, but while they stood at the head of popular
movements which they led in triumph against the
intrusion of alien faiths, the Prophets that we are
now to study stand in decided antagonism to the
popular faith, and the conceptions of Israel's religion
which they reiterate with such passion and insistency
were never acceptable to the people. Their religion
has to make its way against the national religion.</p>

<p>The importance of the Prophets is the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
starting point for the modern study of the Old
Testament, and it is from the earnest perusal of their
writings that modern Biblical science has been forced
to take up a rigorous criticism of the entire literature
of the Old Testament. Under the old methods, the
Prophets had only a secondary position in the history
of the ancient revelation, since their message was
conceived as rather concerned with an age yet to
come than with their own times and needs. The
Divine Law had already been given to the people,
constituting a perfect norm of religion. When the
people failed to obey the Law, then the Prophet
appeared, enforced its principles, and condemned the
people's apostasy. If that message was rejected, as
it often was, then nothing was left for the Prophet
but the proclamation of vengeance, or the prediction
of a time when the Law should be ideally fulfilled by
the revelation of the Gospel. Between the Law and
the Gospel, therefore, stood the Prophets, but they
acted only as a bridge from the one to the other. The
natural method of studying their writings was to
search for the fulfilment of their predictions in
history. With these aims it was perhaps inevitable
that their words should often be interpreted in a
quite unwarrantable manner; events were read back
into their prophecies, or the fulfilment was found in
such ordinary coincidences that the dignity of prediction
was itself lost, the study became puerile and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
morbid, while a fancied necessity as to what they must
mean prevented any scholarly and unbiassed interpretation.
Their works have consequently been
largely used as mysterious oracles from which the
future history of the world could be accurately
predicted. To read the Prophets in order to obtain a
picture of their own age was regarded as a secular
occupation, while every attempt to recover the
original application of their words was regarded as
an endeavour to discountenance the proofs of Divine
revelation. Many of their words bear remarkable
likeness to the gracious invitations of the Gospel, so
that they have been used equally with the New
Testament for Gospel preaching, but it was never
dreamed that they were real invitations to the people
of their own times, founded on the eternal laws of
God's forgiveness afterwards made clear in Christ;
they were simply words spoken under mental effects
which transferred the speakers to the time of the
New Testament. Whatever the final results of the
application of historical criticism may be, it has
already laid religion under a permanent obligation in
its discovery of the hitherto unrealised importance of
the Prophets. At first attention was directed to
their exalted ethical and religious standpoint, appearing
as it did in an age that neither produced nor
responded to it; minute study then showed that they
gave first-hand and incidental accounts of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
times. Their messages bear witness to the contemporary
state of the religion of Jehovah and the
people's morals, and although it may be that they
sometimes judged these from their own high standard,
which caused them to paint them somewhat darker
than an absolutely historical judgment would demand,
yet on what the prevailing religious opinions of the
day really were, they are the best evidence. The
startling but unassailable deduction made from the
Prophets' accounts of their own times is, that in
matters religious they were proclaiming doctrines
that seemed to their contemporaries entirely novel.
The Prophets do not, however, acquiesce in the charge
of novelty. They profess to go back to the original
and inner meaning of Jehovah's choice of the nation.
They refer to this choice, as a "covenant," and to
the religion demanded by it, as the law of the Lord.
The first inference is that they refer to that which
<i>we</i> know as the Law, the Pentateuch, or Law of
Moses. A comparison with the Prophetic teaching
with the ordinances of, say, the Book of Leviticus,
shows that this cannot be the case, for they do not
correspond. Many things there commanded as
essential are passed over in silence by the Prophets;
but the force of the argument is not wholly drawn
from that, although it has a weight here which the
argument from silence cannot usually carry, because
both Leviticus and the Prophets' teaching set forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the essentials of religion, and there can be no
possibility of doubt that the conceptions of the
essentials have an altogether different outlook. It is
chiefly, though not by any means entirely, from the
standpoint of the Prophetical writings that modern
criticism is forced to revise the conception of the progress
and decline of religion that Jewish tradition
has embodied in the arrangement of its Scriptures,
and especially in the ascription of the Pentateuch as
a whole to the age and authorship of Moses. The
verdict from this comparison between the Prophets
and the Law is, that the five Books of Moses either
did not exist in their present form at the time of
the Prophets, or, if they did, remained entirely
unknown to them.</p>

<p>The historical value of the Prophets is therefore to
be rated very high, not only because of their transparent
sincerity, but also because the historical
data which can be secured from them are given
indirectly, and are valuable for the same reason
as the remarks of a contemporary diarist. They are
unaware that they are writing history, and are
consequently free from the almost unescapable tendency
of the historian to make the facts fit into
preconceived theories. Modern criticism, therefore,
does rightly in making the Prophets of paramount
importance for the understanding of the Old Testament,
and when the Prophets are thus made the test, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
in the history that was either completely hidden or
difficult to understand, becomes visible and clear, and
the progress of Israel's religion is displayed in all its
grandeur and movement.</p>

<p>We can now turn to examine the extent of the
sources from which we may draw, in order to
estimate the religious opinions and influence of the
Prophets, and to examine the peculiar character of
the literature for which they are responsible.</p>

<p>First in importance stand the Books of the
Prophets proper. In the ancient division of the
Hebrew Bible into, (1) The Law, (2) The Prophets,
(3) The Hagiographa, or the holy writings, "The
Prophets" included, beside our Books of the Prophets,
such historical Books as Joshua, Judges, Samuel and
Kings. Significantly enough, however, Daniel is not
grouped with the Prophets, but with the Hagiographa,
either because it was not classed as prophecy, or
more probably because the Canon of "The Prophets"
had been closed by the time it was written.</p>

<p>Therefore, in addition to the writings ascribed to
the Prophets, there is a literature which has been
influenced by their teaching, and this is found
largely in those historical Books which have thus been
rightly included in the Prophetical division of the
Hebrew Bible. That is to say, however, that Books
dealing with history prior to the rise of the Prophets,
show traces of an influence that can only have emerged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
later. It is here that criticism seems to the ordinary
reader to enter very debatable ground, although
among critical students of the Bible the question is
no longer an open one. They claim that the peculiar
conditions under which Hebrew history was compiled
allow us to discern, and to separate with ease, this
later prophetical editing, whereas in other literatures
such would be impossible. History was compiled
among the Jews largely from pre-existing documents,
much as it is everywhere, with the difference that in
the Old Testament the records have been simply
pieced together with whatever corrections and
reductions were rendered necessary, while the conceptions
of the later times, when this re-editing was
accomplished, are often simply superimposed; this
method has been ridiculed as an invention of the
critical mind, but it is simply an indisputable if
tiresome fact which has to be taken into account in
any serious study of the literature. The narratives
of the documents that have been named "J" and
"E" bear the marks of having been combined under
the influence of prophetical teaching, since this
teaching, it is to be noted, is recognisably incompatible
with other parts of the stories which have
been left untouched.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that criticism seems to
assume that religion progressed until it reached a
certain height in the Eighth Century, and to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
this theory to stand all marks of this supposed later
type appearing earlier are classed as interpolations.
It is usual to trace this theory to "Evolution gone
mad." Even on the critical theories this cannot
however be legitimately shown to result, since critical
reconstruction shows that the supreme height gained
in the Prophets was never maintained, but suffered a
perceptible decline. Whatever the guiding idea of
criticism may be, it cannot be an endeavour to make
the history of Israel's religion confirm some theory
of the natural development and evolution of religion.
The critical theories leave us with the problem of
moral lapses to account for and with the failure of
vision to explain, and demand still a moral insight to
detect the cause. But it is clear to many that the
moral causes do stand out more clearly discoverable
by this method.</p>

<p>The critical theory of the priority of the Prophets
is not based only upon the emergence under their
teaching of certain theological ideas for the first
time; but also on the difference of style and
vocabulary which can be recognised after only a
slight acquaintance with the language; and on the
general outline of the history that the Bible itself
forces upon us. It is a fact which the reader can
soon discover for himself, that the historical Books
are compilations from the records of various ages,
and these various ages can be as easily discerned as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the conflicting styles of an oft-restored church, or the
disturbance of the normal geological strata that
demands some upheaval for its explanation. It
must be remembered that all this is made possible
from the fact of the remarkable uniformity of ideas
that characterises the various stages of Hebrew
religion.</p>

<p>The Prophets' teaching can therefore be traced
outside their own writings; mainly in fragmentary
comments added to the narratives; or in a superimposed
colouring, which easily falls off, leaving the
original outlines in view; but it is supposed to be
found grouped into one great mass in the Book of
Deuteronomy. The critics' theory of this Book is
that it is an endeavour to reduce the teaching of the
Prophets, more especially that of Isaiah, to a code,
and to secure reform by the centralisation of worship
at Jerusalem. This idea of a central worship, which
leaves no record of its actual observance until the
time of Josiah, or perhaps an attempt in the reign of
Hezekiah, is so unmistakable and is so uniformly
expressed that the work of this author (perhaps we
should say, this school) can be easily detected, and
many of the Books, such as Judges and Kings, can
be seen to have been subjected to a "Deuteronomist"
redaction. In all these phenomena we have teaching
that presupposes the Prophets, and that stands in
contrast and often in conflict with the general tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of the original. It is remarkable that with such redactions
of history any clue to the earlier conceptions
should have been left to us, especially that there
should have been left in the records anything
that would be in disagreement with the editors'
ideas, but the Jews, like the other nations of
antiquity, did not possess modern notions of exactness,
and their notions of history prevented them
from understanding things that were removed only a
short distance from their own times.</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising to find that this Prophetical
literature was in turn liable to redaction, though in a
different degree and for a different reason, since it
has been preserved to us under peculiar conditions.
This at first may seem terribly confusing to the
bewildered student, and it is here that tired men
reject criticism and all its works. To such the
reminder cannot be spared that in any branch of
Science the same conditions have to be overcome,
and if he would understand the Old Testament and
reap the magnificent reward that its earnest study
gives, he must be prepared to face the facts and
labour at their solution.</p>

<p>First of all then, it must be noted that the Books
of the Prophets are not so much literature, in the
ordinary sense of the word, as reported rhetoric, with
the qualification that the reporter and the speaker
may be usually assumed to be the same. In most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
cases the speeches were written out by the Prophet
himself soon after they were delivered, although
sometimes this was done by others long after, and
expanded or altered, as is actually reported to have
been the case with the prophecies of Jeremiah
(Jer. xxxvi.).</p>

<p>In the second place, the literature reveals the fact
that there does not seem to have been in that age any
conception of literary property; ideas are borrowed
directly from one Prophet by another, and sometimes
direct quotation is made without any acknowledgment
or indication of the source. The Prophet's
scribe, his school or followers, could amend or
paraphrase; later generations could evidently insert a
qualifying phrase, temper a threat with a qualifying
condition, or to the doom of exile add a promise of
restoration. When it is noticed that messages like
those of Amos or Hosea end unexpectedly in hopeful
words, and when it is recollected that these Prophets
have been used as Service Books in the Synagogue
and may have been therefore altered to suit the
purpose, then we shall understand the problem that
faces us and why a shadow of suspicion should rest
on promises of restoration that are to be found in
pre-exilic writings. Let it be remembered however
that it is no true critical canon to assume that prediction
cannot be made; but what are we to do when
such a prediction fits ill with the context, breaks the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
sense, is foreign to the outlook of the speaker, and is
in later style?</p>

<p>Finally, there seem to have been many prophecies
circulated anonymously, and since a place had to be
found for these they were inserted in other writers,
on no principle that we can discover, or more often
were grouped together at the end of some notable
Prophet's works. In Zechariah we have to suppose
three strata of different authorship and date, or
give up the rational study of the Book altogether;
and in the famous case of the Book of Isaiah we have
to suppose that some of the early chapters are the
work of a post-exilic author, while chapters xl.-lxvi.
are a heterogeneous collection by a number of
writers, of which chapters xl.-lv. are recognised to
be by one hand, and that, one of the most wonderful
personalities which has contributed to the Old
Testament; about that grand figure we only know
one thing, that he was not Isaiah of Jerusalem.
This has been called "sawing Isaiah asunder" and
making the Bible a piece of patchwork and the
critics are blamed; but if they are right, these complaints
are not directed at them, but at the Bible
itself, a proceeding which to say the least, is not
pious. When a writer could say many years later
that revelation came of old time in many fragments
(Heb. i. 1), others beside critics fall under these
hasty condemnations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
It is refreshing to turn from this less interesting
part of our subject, which nevertheless demands
serious study from anyone who would be informed
where ignorance has done and still is doing so much
harm, and to examine the features which distinguish
the work of the literary Prophets. We have already
spoken of the novelty of their message. Whatever
theory is chosen for the study of Old Testament
history, nothing quite prepares us for the message of
the Prophet Amos. What an inspiration we miss
because he does not stand in our Bibles in his rightful
place, at the head of the Prophets! His bravery
and ruggedness remind us of Elijah, but he brings
something that Elijah is far from giving us. Elijah
was very jealous for the due recognition of Jehovah
as the only God for Israel; Amos is jealous for the
recognition of the true <i>character</i> of Jehovah. That
is to say, we receive from Amos definite teaching
concerning the character of Jehovah and His
relations to the people of Israel, and these doctrines
are startling to Israelitish ears.</p>

<p>Almost the first thing that strikes us as an outstanding
characteristic of the Prophets is that they
are conscious of a call to which they often appeal.
Five of them definitely refer to the circumstances of
their call (Amos vii. 14; Hosea i. 2; Isaiah vi.;
Jer. i. 4&ndash;10; Ezek. i. 1&ndash;ii. 3). The same is true of
their predecessors, but in a different way; they stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
as defenders of the national religion because they
belong to the prophetic guilds or possess certain gifts
of vision. On the other hand the literary Prophets
are against the national religion as a perversion of
the true, and to this weary and warlike work they
are called by immediate and special summons of
God. This call is not self-originated nor can it be
evaded (Jer. xx. 9), and in some cases there has
been no preparation for the office (Amos vii. 14, 15),
and even positive unfitness (Jer. i. 6). They are very
careful therefore to distinguish themselves from the
schools of prophets. Professionalism has disappeared,
and in Jeremiah the official idea also vanishes.</p>

<p>The peculiar mental condition of the Prophets
has of late years attracted a great deal of attention.
The rapture and holy frenzy into which they are
sometimes thrown remind us of the phenomena
accompanying the early Prophetism, studied in our
last lecture; but this is now accidental and is
becoming rare. The Prophets often speak of this as
"the hand of the Lord" upon them (Isa. viii. 11);
in the visions of Ezekiel the effect is often described
as overpowering (Ezek. iii. 14 ff.). There is a
similarity between the accompaniments of these
states and the trances which have been found in so
many religious movements, and which are now
attracting the attention of the scientific world so
seriously. Only the results differ remarkably from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the effects obtained in hypnotic and sub-conscious
states, with which the prophetic gift has sometimes
been compared. The Prophet still exhibits his natural
style when under the influence of the Word of the
Lord. Yet it may be that there is something to
be learned along the lines of modern research; we
know that if certain states of mental passivity can be
induced, there lies open a new realm of knowledge,
which, although it can be accounted for, cannot
be summoned under ordinary mental conditions; add
to this the superior moral constitution which seems
to be missing from the mediums of spiritualistic
phenomena to-day, and the prophetic consciousness
becomes more comprehensible. The Prophets often
speak of visions, but it is difficult to gather their actual
character. It can hardly be objective; it is more like
the artistic vision which creates within the mind in
perfect detail and objectivity, so that what is seen has
greater reality than any reproduction on canvas or in
stone. The mind would seem to project its vision
by the strength of its imaginative powers, so that,
owing to the emotion aroused by the nature of the
truth perceived, the revelation appears to come
from an entirely external source. Sometimes it
would seem to be an actual beholding of some
natural object, which induces a train of thought, as
the case of Amos's vision of the plumb-line may well
be. We cannot think either of any organic hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of their message, since they sometimes also declare
that they "see" it.</p>

<p>Their predictive power has been exaggerated,
chiefly because it was thought that this was the only
office of the Prophet. Where it occurs it is mostly
a natural deduction from their insight into the movements
of their age, their conception of the unchangeable
character of Jehovah, and their belief in
His providential government; the emphasis is never
upon details, and it may be added that the prediction
is by no means always fulfilled. Their vision of the
future usually takes a certain outline, or order; a
national calamity is immediately impending, in which
they recognise the punishment of the people's sins
and the complete triumph and vindication of Jehovah;
this will result in a purifying of the nation, and in the
immediate succession there will come the Messianic
or ideal era. Still there are predictions which cannot
be explained on any theory yet broached, such as the
prediction by Isaiah of the destruction of Sennacherib's
army, or Jeremiah's prophecy of the Restoration. If
this is ordinary second sight, then it is strange that it
should have occurred in so many cases at this time
when prophecy was dropping its mysterious accompaniments.
Yet it may be recalled that in the
history of all nations there has been, in times of great
national affliction, a tendency to prophecy of this
order, which can sometimes claim a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
fulfilment. The distinguishing glory of Israel's prophecy
is, however, to be sought in its ethical character,
and it is perhaps to the writings of men like our own
Carlyle, where we often catch the old prophetic ring,
that we are to look for its analogy.</p>

<p>Among the things that separate Amos from his
predecessors is the use of a literary channel for the
dissemination of his teaching, which was of course
primarily preaching. This in itself marks a great
change. What was it that led the Prophet to write
down the message which he had delivered? It may
have been that there was a tendency towards literature
at that particular period, but even before this
the habit of keeping records must have commenced,
while there is evidence of collections of poems or
sagas, such as the Book of Jasher, or the Book of
the Wars of the Lord, being in existence from a very
early period. It is evident therefore that we need
some particular occurrence to account for the
adoption of literature as the vehicle of Prophecy. It
has been suggested that the cause is to be sought
initially in the rejection of the message of Amos by
those to whom it was delivered: he was aware of
the permanent application of the truths that he had
delivered, and since his own times would not hearken
he resolved to commit them to the verdict of posterity.
The example once set, it was natural for the succeeding
Prophets to wish to give something more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the fleeting character of the spoken word to teaching
that was new and that had been rejected, and therefore
to adopt this form (Isa. viii. 16 f.). Whatever
the cause, we are thankful for the results.</p>

<p>The channel chosen for the preservation of their
messages was not purely literary; the form is not
that of the essay, or thesis; it has not the studied
elegance of poetry, yet it rises above prose, and
rhythmic verse is found scattered throughout their
writings. These reports of passionate oratory fall
naturally into poetic form as the Prophet is carried
away by his message. Especially do we find a very
extensive use of symbolism, which has proved a trap
into which the literalist has hastened to fall.</p>

<p>The relation of the Prophets to the State is difficult
for us accurately to appreciate. Samuel, Elijah,
and Elisha headed what were practically popular
revolutions; in them nationalism overshadows the
universally religious, or the purely moral ideal. To
appreciate the contrast that the literary Prophets
present to this, a careful study should be made of
2 Kings ix. 7&ndash;10; x. 30, and this compared with
the verdict of Hosea, which rises above the standard
of State interest to a judgment of universal morals
(Hosea i. 4). The literary Prophets have no office
at court and receive no fee (Micah iii. 2); but
they have an official connection with the nation,
which they regard as the chosen instrument for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
establishment of God's reign; they have no conception
of a secular state for Israel. It became therefore
a tragedy for Jeremiah to be so completely
rejected by the nation, for then he felt his prophetic
office really ceased. It was this that drove him into
a personal relationship with God that is not reached
by any other of the Prophets. It is not correct to
say that the Prophets were social reformers or
practical politicians. Their sole concern is with
religion, but it is a religion that goes very deep,
and that must express itself in social and national
ethics.</p>

<p>It is however upon their distinctive message that
the chief interest centres, not only for the understanding
of their age, but for their permanent contribution
to religion.</p>

<p>It is a declaration of pure ethical Monotheism.
Jehovah is not simply the tutelary deity of Israel;
He is the Only God. The gods of the other nations
are not real beings; this truth is vividly expressed in
the scorn which is poured on idols and their worship.
Jehovah is a spiritual Being; therefore the crusade
against the idols that had been used in the worship
of Jehovah is an outcome of prophetic teaching.
This condemnation of idols in the worship of Jehovah
is not actually met with until Hosea (xiii. 2), but
that any visible form of Jehovah is derogatory to
the true conception of His glory is the only possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
deduction from prophetic teaching. We still get the
naïve terms that refer to Jehovah as if He had bodily
parts; but this is nothing more than the necessary
imagery which all spiritual conceptions have to
employ, and which are not mistaken by any save the
most ignorant. This purely spiritual Being fills the
whole universe (Deut. x. 14; 1 Kings viii. 27;
Jer. xxiii. 24; esp. Isa. xxxi. 3, which implies more
clearly than any other statement in the Old Testament
the spirituality of God, and thus anticipates
the declaration of Jesus to the woman of Samaria).
But it is with the <i>ethical</i> character of Jehovah that
they are mostly concerned. He is righteous; which
means more than the early conception that He
simply defends Israel's right. They insist on His
complete impartiality, which no choice of Israel for
His own can turn aside: "You only have I known
of all the families of the earth, <i>therefore</i> will I visit
upon you all your iniquities." They fall back again
and again on His absolute fidelity and truthfulness.
The arbitrary character which is ascribed to Jehovah
in the Books of Samuel has completely disappeared;
the Prophet can say: "Come and let us reason
together, saith Jehovah."</p>

<p>Universalism is the necessary corollary to Monotheism,
but the strong sense of Israel as His chosen
instrument hinders the clear statement of this truth
by the Prophets. A particular regard for Israel still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
colours their vision; but they are altogether against
the popular estimate in maintaining that this choice
was made solely as a means for reaching the whole
world. Universalism is seen forming in the idea that
Jehovah is concerned with the punishment of other
nations, since He it is who will punish them for their
sins; not only for their hatred of His chosen, but for
their cruelty to other nations: He will punish Moab
for his inhumanity to Edom (Amos ii. 1). This is
a great advance. Even when the surrounding
nations afflict Israel it is not because the Lord has no
control over them, but it is He that raises up the
hostile powers as instruments of His chastisement.
Even kinder views are to be found in Amos, in whose
tiny book we find nearly all the characteristic ideas
of the Prophets; for Jehovah is said to have been
concerned in the early migratory movements not
only of the Hebrews, but of the hated Philistines and
Assyrians (Amos ix. 7). The grand universalism
of Isaiah xix. 19&ndash;25 only needs us to recall the part
that Egypt and Assyria played in the history of
Israel, in order to appreciate its magnanimity. Yet
in spite of these passages, the outlook as a whole is
centred on Israel, and works of a definitely universalistic
nature could hardly have found a place in
the canon. This spirit probably made it necessary
for the writer of "Jonah" to embody his universalistic
doctrines in the form of an obscure parable about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Prophet and a whale. It was the same national
bigotry that led to the rejection of the Son of man.</p>

<p>It is in the idea of the conditions of the covenant
between Jehovah and Israel that the teaching of the
Prophets stands in such contrast to the conceptions
of the people. That relation was conceived of, as
we have seen, as tribal; the Prophets declare it to
rest on a covenant of choice, which is to be maintained
by the adherence of the parties to the original
terms. They love to place in contrast the unwearied
faithfulness of Jehovah and the fickleness of the
people; while they alternate between threats of
Jehovah's complete rejection and the recurring
thought that despite all He can never change, and
against all known custom will even welcome back
the harlot nation. Jehovah's requirements from
Israel, for the proper maintenance of the covenant,
are simply the full allegiance of the people; but how
this is to be displayed is not so definitely described.
There must be a pure worship of Jehovah, but this is
not to find expression in accurate ritual or great
sacrifices. Indeed it cannot be claimed that the
Prophets are at all concerned about ritual. The Book
of Deuteronomy distinctly lays down that the true
worship of Jehovah is to be performed at one chosen
central spot, while Leviticus provides an elaborate
method of approach, which can only be neglected at
the peril of the worshipper. On the other hand, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
is certain that the Prophets found the people worshipping
at the "high places," the old Canaanitish
shrines, with many customs which would be a direct
infringement of the Code of Leviticus, yet they are
entirely unconcerned with these faults. The principle
of sacrifice as a means of worship had existed from
ancient times, and is to be found in nearly all
religions; yet there is an overwhelming verdict from
the pre-exilic Prophets that shows that they are
doubtful of its Divine appointment or of its necessity.
(These passages should be carefully examined:&mdash;Amos
v. 25; Hosea vi. 6; Isa. i. 11&ndash;17; Micah vi.
6&ndash;8; 1 Sam. xv. 22; Jer. vi. 20; vii. 21&ndash;23; and
Jeremiah may have been a priest!) There is only
one conclusion possible; these Prophets had never
seen the Book of Leviticus.</p>

<p>The ritual which the Prophets seek is that of an
upright life. They base all their morality on religious
ideas. The great incentive to moral conduct is the
recognition that the whole nation and land is the
property of Jehovah; any social wrong is wrong
against Him. So we find that the earliest attempt to
formulate this teaching in a code contains many
regulations which are purely humanitarian (Deut.
xiv. 29; xix. 2 ff.; xxi. 10&ndash;17; xxii. 1&ndash;3; xxiv.
6, 10&ndash;15). Ritual is turned into ethics. Against
the inequalities and injustices of their day the
Prophets set their faces, with an utter disregard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
for consequences: they hurled their accusations at
the nation with tremendous energy, in public, before
kings, as men went up to worship; fiery denunciation
mingling with a patriot's tears; for the time,
all unavailing. Yet they have had their harvest, and
to-day they are among the voices that call men to
social reform.</p>

<p>It will be well to endeavour to show, in the
briefest possible outline, the historic setting of this
mighty message.</p>

<p>It was shortly after the opening of the Eighth
Century that threatening indications began to gather
on the horizon of Northern Israel. The situation
called for a Prophet's message. Amos, the herdman
of Tekoa, comes like a whirlwind from Judah, utters
his message at Bethel and returns. He is the first
and in many respects the greatest of that meteoric
band who illumine the dark night of Israel's history;
later Prophets repeat his words and share his ideas.
Hosea, from the Northern Kingdom, follows in his
steps, but with a message made the more tender from
the fact that the whole drama of Israel's unfaithfulness
to her husband Jehovah had been brought home
to him in a personal domestic tragedy. The tender
heart which led him to forgive his unfaithful wife,
wondered if Jehovah would not be equally forgiving,
and through this experience he almost penetrates to
the thought of God as Love. A few years later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
a voice is heard in the villages of Judah proclaiming
the message of Amos with the same call to simple
reality: Micah pleads for simple life, simple worship,
simple justice. With this transference of the
prophetic voice to the Southern Kingdom there
falls an awful silence on the North. In 722 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>,
Samaria fell before the arms of Assyria, and Israel
ceased to exist. For centuries that land was to
remain silent and despised, until there should come
from Galilee of the Gentiles He of whom all the
Prophets spake. One would expect that the awful
doom which had overtaken the Northern Kingdom
would not have been without effect on Judah. Its
only visible effect was the strengthening of her belief
in her own inviolability, and the acceptance of the
idea that Israel's fall was due to her separation from
Judah. If a Prophet could have turned the people's
thought in a saner direction, then it would have been
accomplished by Isaiah, the most princely and the
most literary of all the Prophets. His work was not
indeed without effect. He was the means of lifting
prophecy into popular favour, and a revival followed
his teaching. The chief cause of this favour was
the events of the memorable year, 701 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> In face
of the demands of Assyria, Isaiah had all along
counselled submission and the avoidance of all
intrigues with Egypt. But the violation of the treaty
by Sennacherib, who demanded the surrender of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
city after he had been bought off, roused the anger
of Isaiah. In answer to the insulting message of the
Rabshakeh, while the army lay round the city, in
obedience to the word of Jehovah he counsels
resistance. Nothing seemed more improbable than
that there could be any escape for Jerusalem; nevertheless
he declared that the holy city should be
inviolable. The great host with their insolent
captain lay before the gates, but in the morning</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The Gentile, unsmote by the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had melted like snow in the glance of the Lord."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Whatever the actual cause of the raising of the
siege may have been, there can be no doubt that
something did happen to the Assyrian army which
Isaiah was able to attribute to the intervention of
Jehovah, for from this time Isaiah became famous.
To those who see in the fulfilment of prediction the
chief end of prophecy this event will naturally seem
of profound importance. To another view of the
function of prophecy this is the least thing that
Isaiah did, for while it lifted his name into popular
favour, that same deliverance proved a snare to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem. For his declaration of the
city's inviolability was remembered long after, and
quoted as if it had been of universal, instead of
temporary application, while his moral teaching was
forgotten. To that trick of national memory the
exile was largely due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
From this time the sacrosanct character of the city
obsessed the popular mind, and in consequence the
Temple became, for the first time since its erection, of
supreme significance in Jewish eyes. Following
Isaiah, there was a movement, commenced probably
by his disciples, that strove to bring the Temple
into prominence as the one authorised place of
worship. Possibly during the reactionary reign of
Manasseh, when their master is said to have been
martyred, they worked at this idea, and driven into
silence by the persecutions of the king they employed
their pens in producing a code of laws, which
undoubtedly gathered into legal form many of the
customs which had existed for centuries, and
endeavoured to give them the religious interpretation
of the prophetic teaching. Its chief injunction was
the suppression of the high places as no longer
authorised for the worship of Jehovah, hoping to
centre thereby the whole of the nation's worship at
the Temple. This code was probably laid up for
publication in brighter days, and was discovered in
the reign of Josiah, in the year 621 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> There can
be but little doubt, from the reforms instituted, and
from the total disregard of them until this time, that
this code was our Book of Deuteronomy. Since it
was published under the name of Moses, many
moderns have looked upon its compilation as a pious
forgery. This is to read into a past age the legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
conceptions of Western civilisation. It must be
remembered that many of these laws could be
legitimately traced back to Moses or to his influence,
and there was no idea of deception in using his name.
The hand of the School which produced this work
can also be traced in the compilation and redaction of
other historical works, which were undertaken with
this idea of making the past history teach the value
of the reforms they wished the people to adopt.
This was not only regarded as legitimate, but as a
sacred duty imposed upon them. The modern
historical ideal, which instigates research with the
sole intention of discovering the facts, is only the
product of our own age, and is still unsuccessfully
striven after. The reformation under Josiah is
therefore known as the Deuteronomic reformation.
From this time the Temple becomes the only spot
where God can be publicly worshipped, and the local
shrines are forbidden. This may seem an arbitrary
action, and it is possible that for some time it called
forth loud complaints; but it was certainly for the
benefit of religion. It had been proved to be
impossible to dissociate the local shrines from the
customs and ideas which had descended from the
original Canaanitish worship carried on there. With
a central worship it was found possible to check
practices that were not in accordance with the
religion of Jehovah. The teaching of the Prophets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
finds then in the Book of Deuteronomy its first-fruits
of reform.</p>

<p>The relation of one young man to this new movement
is full of peculiar interest and difficulty. It
was at this very time that Jeremiah began his
ministry, and it is possible that he took some part in
the movement (Jer. xi. 8). He also lived to see
the reaction and to prove that the reform was only
superficial. There is one passage which seems to point
to a change of view and even to the suspicion that
the new code was not authoritative (Jer. vii. 8).
When Jeremiah attacked the sin of the people, and
warned them that the presence of Jehovah's Temple
would not suffice to protect them if they persisted in
their iniquity, his message was rejected and eventually
he was imprisoned and silenced by a coalition
of the priests and prophets. Jeremiah ceased therefore
to be the Prophet of that nation. In his
loneliness and sorrow, his thoughts turned in an
hitherto unexplored direction. He complains to God
in words which sound almost blasphemous, and
pours forth expostulations that are the reverse of the
submissive spirit usually thought proper to religion;
but it is through this agony that Jeremiah discovers
that God can be something to him, not only as the
Prophet of the nation, but for himself. He discovers
personal religion. His next discovery is equally
momentous; for he is led to see that no promulgation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
of laws can save the nation: ordinances do not
change the heart. He sorrowfully pronounces the
doom of the nation, but as he stands by its open
grave he sings of its resurrection. When purged by
trial the nation shall return, and the New Covenant
shall be set up, in which Jehovah shall write His
laws in their hearts. It is a long far-off look that he
gives, and the picture is not complete until One sits
at a last supper and says: This cup is the New
Covenant in my blood.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of uncertainty about the above dates, and the
condition of the documents in Ezra-Nehemiah offers difficulties which
have not, so far, found acceptable solutions. Some have sought to
identify Sheshbazzar with Zerubbabel, and to bring down the date of the
Return to 522&ndash;21.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EFFECT OF THE EXILE</span></h3>

<p>In the year 597 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, a catastrophe long foretold
befell the Kingdom of Judah. Nebuchadrezzar
invaded the land, took Jerusalem, and robbing the
land of every person of importance or usefulness,
transported them together with King Jehoiachin to
Babylon, hoping doubtless to prevent any further
trouble with Judæa. In what a conflict of emotion
must the exiles have left that city which they had
fondly imagined inviolable! for even in Babylon they
continued to believe that so long as Jerusalem stood,
Jehovah would have a citadel, and the holy city
would remain a symbolic witness to their unconquered
religion. With the captives there went a
young man who was destined to leave a deep impression
upon the future of his nation&mdash;the priest Ezekiel.
Arrived in Babylon, he felt himself called to a prophetic
ministry to the exiles, and his first message
was directed to the crushing of their remaining
hopes; for with dramatic symbolism he predicted
that Jerusalem would be utterly destroyed. The
suicidal policy of Zedekiah, whom Nebuchadrezzar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
had left to carry on the government as his vassal,
soon fulfilled this prophecy; for sedition and intrigue
soon compelled Nebuchadrezzar to adopt still stricter
measures. He again marched into Judæa and
besieged Jerusalem. This time the Jews expected no
mercy, and resisted with such tenacity that the siege
lasted for nearly two years. On the ninth day of the
Fourth month, (our July) 586 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, a day still kept
with solemn fasting by the Jews, a breach was made
in the walls and the city capitulated. A month
later the entire destruction of the city and Temple
was ruthlessly carried out, and the whole population,
with the exception of a few husbandmen, was deported
to swell the company of exiles now at Babylon.</p>

<p>This was the inevitable culmination of the policy
of the Kingdom of Judah under her latest monarchs.
The position of their land laid them open to conflicts
with the powers of Assyria and Babylon. The wise
and peaceful policy of Solomon had been departed
from, and indeed rendered impossible by the disruption
of the Tribes. A period of national decadence
seems to have followed, in which luxury and corruption
undermined all political sanity, and both rulers
and people became blind to the dangers that
threatened. Such religion as existed, only expressed
itself in bursts of fanaticism, and filled the people with
the fatal idea that Jehovah would never suffer the
Temple to be violated or the holy city to be taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
The disaster of the Exile is charged by the
Prophets to the unrepented sins of the nation, and
while this is a religious interpretation it is not
unsupported by a review of the history. The people
had set their hearts upon a glorious kingdom of
material prosperity, presided over and protected by a
mighty national deity; the Prophets wanted a kingdom
of righteousness, which would reflect the character
of Jehovah and be a witness to the nations of His
reality and power. While they saw in the Exile a
calamity which meant the destruction of the nation,
and an evidence that Jehovah had broken His
covenant because of disobedience, they clung to the
belief that the end for which Jehovah had chosen
Israel might still be attained. That nation might be
destroyed, yet from its ruins there would arise a
Kingdom of God; a remnant would return, weaned
from a false religion, to work out a new ideal of
holiness and service.</p>

<p>The period which follows is one of great obscurity
and the records which are actually dated from this
time are scanty. Literary criticism however throws
great light on this period because it believes that it
is from the Exile that we are to date many institutions
and writings that have been referred to a
previous age. This may seem at first sight a desperate
device, since so little is known of the actual
conditions; and yet unfettered investigation can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
arrive at no other conclusion, the exilic stamp being
often unmistakable and even showing itself in
geographical outlook (1 Kings iv. 24). If we take
the Bible as it stands, it presents us with the story of
an early legislation given by Moses, neglected however
by the entire people, including the Reformers
and Prophets, until it suddenly appears after the
Exile as the acknowledged code for the regulation of
religion and common life. It would be quite possible
to conceive that the shock of the Exile drove the
Jews to examine the details of the neglected covenant
of Jehovah and to restore the authority of the Law
of Moses. Such however is impossible, not only
from that fact that there is no mention of the Law of
Moses in the records that can be dated between the
Conquest of Canaan and the Exile, but that in this
period we can discern customs and ideas <i>gradually</i>
growing up that find their full and final embodiment in
the Pentateuch as we now possess it. From the lawless
condition of the Judges and the early monarchy,
we advance to the teaching of the Prophets. It is
Isaiah who contributes the ideas which lie at the basis
of the Deuteronomic Code, and the time of Josiah is
the first to show the influence of that code. Ezekiel
is the first to show any trace of the ideas which we
find embodied in Leviticus, but these, as we shall see,
have to be explained as anticipations of, rather than
as an acquaintance with, the finished Levitical Code.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
When we consider what effect the Exile would
have upon the more thoughtful of the Jews, we can
imagine that conscience would be shocked into
activity, and a new interest would be taken in their
strange history, especially in its prophetic interpretation.
It is common in history to find that repentance
rarely goes so deep as to grasp the inner meaning
of its discovered sin, but is apt to content itself with
somewhat superficial methods of showing its sincerity
and securing future compliance with religion. So at
least, the records of Israel's history assure us,
happened in this instance, and one of the resolutions
of their penitence took concrete form in the writing
or editing of their history so that it should be a
warning to the future, and in codifying customs and
drawing up regulations which should make apostasy
for ever impossible. Many references in the ancient
records or in the oral tradition which savoured of
idolatry or of a too anthropomorphic conception of
God were corrected, as those references, the tendency
of which was not detected, have remained to bear
witness; and the whole history was fitted somewhat
clumsily into a mechanical scheme, which was rather
what they thought ought to have happened than
what really did happen. One example of this may
be seen in the condemnation which is naïvely passed
on king after king because he had allowed sacrifice
to be made at the high places; the fact being that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
this was not made illegitimate until the reign of
Josiah. In this way external offences were marked
and abandoned, while the deeper incongruity between
the national religion and the teaching of the Prophets
was missed.</p>

<p>If we seek in this period for the rise of ideas which
shall bridge over the change from the popular religion
on the one hand, and the religion of Jeremiah on the
other, to the complete unity of the national religion
under Nehemiah and Ezra, we shall find a most
important link in the Book of Ezekiel.</p>

<p>The Book of Ezekiel is said to be the least read
book in the Bible, yet its author plays a most
important part in the history of Israel's religion, and
to grasp the position which he occupies is to have a
focus point from which the whole development may
be conveniently grasped. The Prophet probably got
a better hearing from his contemporaries than any of
his predecessors. He accompanied the body of
captives who left Jerusalem for Babylon in the year
597, and his works date from soon after that year
and go down to about 570. The men to whom he
was called to speak were therefore his fellow captives,
and he had not to look far for a text for his sermons.
His hearers were in Babylon for their sins, and they
knew it. His style of preaching is difficult, and his
method of embodying his message in visions marks a
new phenomenon in Israel's religion. He states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
truth in strange and fanciful figures, a method which
was to form an example for the later works of
Judaism, and if we detect in Ezekiel a return to the
extravagance of the earlier prophecy, we must make
allowance for the tragic times in which he lived;
especially must we do this where we trace a falling
off from his predecessors in moral insight and in the
ritualistic influence which his work undoubtedly left
behind him.</p>

<p>Ezekiel continues the work of the pre-exilic
Prophets in that he proclaims their characteristic
doctrines, and naturally he shows distinct traces of
the influence of Jeremiah. What is new, is that he
gives to those doctrines a more fixed and somewhat
pedantic form, and a greater self-consciousness is
discernible; the prophecies are accurately arranged,
and the language is marked by precision; rhetoric is
less frequent, and the prophecies look more fit for
reading than for delivery. The idea of God is the
same as in the earlier Prophets, but in Ezekiel it is
elevated and rarified; especially is great emphasis
laid upon the attribute of holiness, which is however
a ceremonial rather than a purely ethical conception.
The characteristic idea of the Prophets, that Jehovah
chose Israel not for their own sakes, becomes the
idea that Jehovah did this for His own sake alone,
and this is so often repeated that it almost looks like
arbitrariness. The cause of Judah's punishment is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
still traced to the sin of the people, but that sin is
now definitely determined to be idolatry; and this is
insisted on almost to the exclusion of the social and
ethical wrongs assailed by the earlier Prophets.
While, however, Ezekiel enforces the bitter lessons
of the Exile, he carefully distinguishes the true interpretation
of that disaster from that which rose readily
to the popular mind. He disposes of the conception
that the Captivity was due to the inability of Jehovah
to defend His own land (xxxvi. 20); it was a punishment
for sin (xxxix. 23), and in His own time He
will prove this by restoring them to their land again
(xxxix. 25). Neither will he allow them to rest in the
flattering thought that they were only suffering
for the unvisited sins of a former generation; he
insists, probably with greater rigour than experience
would sanction, that each man bears his own sin,
and never suffers for the sins of others. But to those
who admit the justice of his charges, and who therefore
regard the future as hopeless, he preaches a
tender doctrine of forgiveness and the possibility of
cleansing from sin. From the events of his times,
he seeks to draw lessons which should redeem the
mistakes that had been made in the past: the teaching
of the Prophets must be kept before the people
in definite rules and religious ceremonies. Old
customs, whose original significance had long been
forgotten, were invested with new interpretations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
worthy of the true religion of Jehovah, and were
made not only customs, but religious commands. In
the book which bears his name, and especially in
chapters xl.-xlviii., he outlines a policy in which the
whole of national life is comprehended in its religious
significance, and thus the calamity of future apostasy
prevented. The new State is to centre round the
idea of worship: the Temple with its services and
appointments is to be the expression of the national
life. Now in this scheme there is little doubt that
we have the beginning of the Levitical system, for
Ezekiel is related to Leviticus as the rough sketch to
the finished plan. If Leviticus in its present form
existed in Ezekiel's time, then the work of the
Prophet was not only entirely unnecessary, but careless
and presumptuous. Some of the facts which
point to the priority of Ezekiel to the Levitical Code
may be noticed. In the Levitical Code we find that
a distinction is made between priests and Levites.
This is not found in Deuteronomy (xvii. 9, 18;
xviii. 1) but is first found in Ezekiel (xliv. 10&ndash;15),
where it is explained to be due to the degradation of
the Levites as a punishment for leading the people
into idolatry; in Leviticus we reach the final stage,
where the distinction is accepted without explanation.
In Ezekiel we have no mention of the high-priest or
of the Day of Atonement, both of which figure so
largely in the Priest's Code, although we can find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
<i>foreshadowings</i> of the Day of Atonement (Ezek. xlv.
18&ndash;20). Indeed we meet with no mention of the
Day of Atonement, apart from the Priestly Code, until
Zechariah (vii. 5; viii. 19). The general conclusion
may be safely drawn, that during and after the Exile,
Ezekiel's ideas were stiffened and developed into the
full legislation now preserved for us in Leviticus.</p>

<p>We may rightly claim Ezekiel to be the founder of
Judaism, with its transcendent conception of Jehovah
and its great attention to ceremonial detail, and we
are bound therefore to recognise in Ezekiel a falling
off from the ideals of the pre-exilic Prophets; he is a
prophet in priest's clothing. Yet it may be questioned
whether the idealistic teaching of the Prophets
could have been preserved through the periods of the
Exile and the Restoration, without this formal
process. An outer husk of formality had to develop
in order that the living kernel might be protected
during the critical years when Persia, Greece, and
Rome were to press their alien ideas upon this people.
It has been well for the world that Ezekiel clothed
the Prophets' teaching in the resisting garments of
Judaism.</p>

<p>The Exile could not fail to leave upon the Jewish
nation an imperishable mark, and they emerged
from that trial a different people. It was a shock
that brought a repentance the Prophets had often
laboured for in vain, and this repentance was marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
by the initiation of many new movements in thought,
and by a more stringent and solemn observance of
their peculiar institutions. Probably in that alien
land many of the Jews adopted the customs of their
conquerors, since it is estimated that not more than
a small fraction returned to Palestine. This defection
would impress upon those who remained faithful the
necessity for a strict policy of separation, and from
this time certain institutions which had been inherited
from ancient Semitic practice received a new meaning.
Chief among these may be noticed the observance
of the Sabbath, and the rite of circumcision. The
observance of a certain day as sacred to the gods is
a custom that is found in nearly all early religions,
and there are traces of such an observance in the
Babylonian religion. We do not find however in the
historical books of the Bible that mention of the
Sabbath which would be expected, if it was observed
with the strictness common after the Exile. There
are traces of an observance, not strictly defined, save
that it is in association with the new moon feasts, and
is combined with social relaxation (2 Kings iv. 22, 23;
Hosea ii. 11; Amos viii. 5; Isa. i. 13). Even before
the Exile however a more religious conception had
arisen (Jer. xvii. 19&ndash;27), and is even then referred
to as an earlier command. The change after the
Exile was towards an ever increasing strictness
(Isa. lvi. 2, 4, 6; lviii. 13; lxvi. 23; Neh. xiii. 15&ndash;22).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
The rite of circumcision was by no means peculiar
to the Jewish religion (Jer. ix. 25, 26), except perhaps
in so far as it was performed in infancy: its origin
and growth are very obscure. Its original significance
was early lost and its interpretation was probably
due to the Prophets themselves, who often referred
to a spiritual circumcision, and thus made possible
the full ceremonial interpretation which became so
important a feature in later Judaism.</p>

<p>We have seen that there is evidence to prove that
the religion of Israel had not always been averse to
the use of idols as part of the legitimate worship of
Jehovah. The Prophets began the protest against
this, not so much because of its principles, but
because of the immoral practices with which idol
worship was connected. But after the Exile, idolatry
was for ever separated from the worship of Jehovah,
and in the later Prophets idolatry becomes the target
for their most scornful invective. It has been suggested
that this new abhorrence accounts for the non-return of
the Ark, which in this period disappears from history.</p>

<p>Among the most important of the new institutions
that can be traced back to the period of the Exile is the
founding of the Synagogue. In the land of Exile,
away from the one spot where sacrifice was permitted,
worship had to be carried on without the aid of
sacrificial or ceremonial rites, but there was nothing
to prevent the people from gathering together for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
prayer or to hear read their newly reverenced
prophetic books. It is quite possible that this led to
a collection of the Prophets' writings being made,
and perhaps to some editing to meet their present
needs. This movement was of profound importance
for the future development of religion, for it was in
the Synagogue rather than in the Temple that
Christianity was to find the readiest medium for its
dissemination and the earliest model for its worship.
The Synagogue itself prepared the way for the more
spiritual developments within Judaism, for away
from the Temple sacrifices and their always dangerous
suggestions men learned that the sacrifice of the
broken heart was more acceptable to Jehovah; and
so the way was prepared for that magnificent
collection of prayers and songs which we call the
Psalms, which were afterwards to be used as an accompaniment
to a form of worship that they frequently
condemn. The external and legal conceptions
were, however, to be the most visible results gained
from the Exile, and they were to mould religion for
many a year.</p>

<p>The materials for an exact history of the return
from Exile do not exist in our Bibles; the accounts
found in Ezra and Nehemiah raise questions which
have not yet been satisfactorily answered. The
Prophets who had foretold the destruction of the
kingdom of Judah had never been able to rest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
thought that this was the final chapter in Jehovah's
dealings with His people, and their faith forced them
to peer through this impending disaster and dimly
discern a purpose yet to be disclosed. This is often
pictured in merely general terms, but in Jeremiah
and Ezekiel these hopes issued in the definite prophecy
of the restoration of the Jews to their own
land within a certain period. When political changes
brought this on the horizon of possibility, the times
wakened the "voice of one crying in the wilderness,"
in some respects the most wonderful of all that
noble band we have been studying. The name of
this herald has not been preserved, but he is known
to criticism as the Second Isaiah. This does not of
course mean that he bore that name, but it is a convenient
designation for the writings that occupy
the second half of the work included under the name
of Isaiah. The separation of chapters xl.-lxvi.
from those which precede, as from different hands, is
one of the most universally accepted results of
criticism. The preceding chapters end with a
historic survey of events that happened in the
lifetime of the great Isaiah of Jerusalem, and then
suddenly the whole outlook and atmosphere change.
Critics claim that the test of language and style is
itself decisive, but while this must remain a question
on which only Hebrew experts are qualified to
pronounce, the difference of theological ideas, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the change of situation cannot be missed by any
attentive English reader. Indeed that the situation
has changed is a fact which has never been challenged.
From chapter xl., the audience addressed consists no
longer of the proud and scornful peoples of the time
of Hezekiah, but of penitent captives far from their
native land some 150 years later; the accepted
explanation used to be that Isaiah transported himself
to this later time by a miracle of prophetic inspiration.
But there is really only one adducible reason
for attributing this prophecy to Isaiah: it is bound
up with the book that bears his name as the
title. This reason is of little value when we admit
our ignorance of the method by which the Old
Testament was finally edited, and when the internal
evidence entirely contradicts the traditional theory.
For it must be borne in mind that the explanation
that this is due to a prophetic transportation is only
a hypothesis framed to fit the conditions, and has no
claim to acceptance if there can be found one that
does equal justice to the facts without appealing to
such an unusual method. Moreover, the hypothesis
of prediction does not fit the facts, for while some
parts of the prophecy have predictive form, others
have not. For instance, the picture of Cyrus and
his conquests, complete even to the name of the hero,
is not only presented as if he were on the stage of
actual history, but his appearance is adduced as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
convincing evidence of the fulfilment of prophecy.
What fulfilment would it be if Cyrus was yet a figure
of the unknown future? If it is claimed that this
presentation is due to what is known to Hebrew
grammarians as a use of the <i>prophetic present tense</i>, in
which things future in fact, are stated as present,
owing to the vividness of the prophetic consciousness,
then we must ask why it is that Cyrus is presented as
a figure of contemporary history, while the fall of
Babylon is still spoken of as future. This distinction
would be meaningless if the whole of this period was
seen from some anterior time.</p>

<p>The "settled results" of criticism were greatly
ridiculed when further investigation pronounced that
only chapters xl.-lv. can have come from this great
Prophet, and that the remainder of the book is of
a composite character, extending at least to the time
of the Second Temple. To have to bring in a third
author, or even more, to explain this book is quoted
as an example of the foolishness of criticism. Now
the critics <i>may</i> be wrong, but their theories are
simply endeavours to understand these prophecies by
setting them in their exact historical surroundings.
Surely this is a task worthy of any reverent student
of the Old Testament, and if it brings, as many
believe, wonderful light on these messages, and thus
sets free their eternal significance, then these men
should earn gratitude rather than ridicule, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
difficulty of their task calls for a continual rearrangement
and a finer adjustment.</p>

<p>The critical reconstruction of this prophecy therefore
places chapters xl.-lv. among the scenes it
depicts, and in the very history whose movements
called it forth. The exact conditions can be discerned.
After the death of Nebuchadrezzar the
kingdom of the Chaldæans began to decline, and
when Cyrus succeeded to the throne of Persia its
fate was determined. His victorious campaigns,
culminating in the fall of Sardis in <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 547, could
not fail to reach the ears of the exiles in Babylon,
and many a whisper of hope must have been exchanged,
and many a prophecy handed on. Babylon
itself fell before the conqueror in 538 and between
these two dates, and perhaps nearer to the latter, the
internal witness of the prophecy demands that it
should be placed.</p>

<p>When we turn to examine the work of this
unknown messenger we cannot help noticing the
difference in style, which even the translation cannot
obscure. The great Isaiah writes in terse, closely-packed
sentences, with all the authoritative manner
customary with the Prophets. This writer, on the
other hand, is rhetorical, and loves to dwell on his
favourite ideas. The sharp word of the prophetic
deliverance here gives way to a reasoning exposition
and a pleading tenderness that makes this prophecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
a Gospel before the Gospels. The distinctive religious
ideas can be easily marked. Absolute Monotheism
is insisted on with a fulness and repetition which
shows that it is in some degree a new truth. There
is none beside Jehovah; He is alone, unique; and
description is exhausted in the endeavour to picture
His glory and power. He is now constantly referred
to as the Creator of the world, the framer of the
stars on high, the maker of both darkness and light,
both good and evil; so that no room is left for the
dualism that the Prophet may have learned to
despise in the Babylonian religion. His finest scorn
is reserved for the conception that an idol can have
any claim to divinity. He depicts the process of
their manufacture, their utter helplessness; it may
be that he had seen them borne in to the capital as
the suburbs fell before the invader.</p>

<p>Universalism struggles for expression in this writer,
but it is not always so clear and definite as in the
writings of the great Isaiah. This arises however,
not so much from the racial prejudices that have
so clogged the Hebrew mind, as from a reading of
Israel's history which the prophet was well entitled
to make, namely, that she was to be the premier
nation in the instruction of the world in righteousness
and the knowledge of God, the priest-nation of
humanity. This conception of the nation's history
and destiny is embodied in a personification known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
as the Servant of Jehovah. Israel has been chosen
as the Servant so that the light may be brought to
the nations. In this mission the Servant meets with
persecution, yet turns not back from those who pluck
off the hair nor hides his face from shame and
spitting. The slightest retrospect of Israel's history
shows that the Servant of Jehovah was trained for
his task only through suffering. Israel had suffered
for her sins of presumption and disobedience; but were
the nations who punished her any more righteous?
Moreover, many of those who sat down by the
waters of Babylon and wept when they remembered
Zion must have been pious and righteous, and
innocent of the causes of their nation's calamities.
As the prophet broods over the meaning of the Exile,
as it affected the godly remnant, he begins to see
that this suffering, undeserved though it might be in
particular cases, would become a supreme lesson in
righteousness to the world. This assumption is
embodied in the astonishing drama of the suffering
Servant; one who suffers from a disfiguring disease,
which marks him out to all beholders as the afflicted
of Jehovah, and who is therefore despised and
rejected of men. But the day comes when the idea
slowly dawns upon men that this servant-nation
suffered for the sake of the world, bore the consciousness
of sin when other nations lived in carelessness
and flourished on cruelty. The Prophet believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
that this patient suffering would be an awakening
force and would be the means of bringing the world
to the knowledge of God. It is a marvellous reading
of Israel's history; but it is true, for that little
nation despised and rejected by Empires, battered
by the armed forces which surrounded her, has made
the whole world her debtor. But indirectly this
interpretation is a revelation of the meaning of all
history, and especially of that strange law of vicarious
suffering which binds all the world one and makes
every new age in debt to the past. This unknown
writer has contributed one of the most fruitful ideas
to the philosophy of history.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that most early commentators
have tried to read in the 53rd chapter a picture, not
of a nation, but of some definite person; although
the Prophet definitely identifies the Servant of the
Lord with Israel (Isa. xli. 8). But when did Israel
embody such a conception? It can only stand for an
ideal of what Israel ought to have been; and there
have been many things which have entered into the
composition of the picture. It has been suggested
that one of the Prophets sat for this picture,
just as sometimes an artist painting a symbolical
picture will get one of his friends to sit for the
model; and who could be better for this purpose
than Jeremiah, the rejected of the nation? The
interpretation that finds in this picture a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
prediction of the life and passion of Jesus is not
sanctioned by a careful study of the passage; but the
instinct that has led to this is right in the main,
for as we travel down the ages looking for the fulfilment
of this ideal, we only rest with complete
satisfaction on the story of the life and death of One
who stepping out from this very race, by His uninterrupted
communion with God, His hatred of sin
and His profound sympathy with mankind, bore
away the sin of the world on the red flood of sacrifice,
and brought in for ever the true Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>An increasing number of Old Testament scholars
believe that another of the Prophets contains an
interpretation of the Exile, conceived in the same
spirit as that of the Second Isaiah, although veiled
under such a strange allegorical form that centuries
of Jewish and Christian interpretation have entirely
missed its meaning. The book of the Prophet Jonah
belongs to a later age, and should probably stand last
of all the Minor Prophets, but the critical interpretation
of the prophecy falls naturally to be considered
here. The character of the Book reveals on close
inspection that it was never intended for history; as
its inclusion among the prophetical writings perhaps
recognises. It is not only the improbability of the
whale episode that has led to this conclusion, but
the whole character of the events narrated: the
sudden growth and withering of the gourd, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
instant repentance of the Ninevites, which included
a forced régime of fasting even for the cattle! Moreover,
the closing words of the book breathe a spirit
of universalism and humanity that is almost the
high-water mark of Old Testament inspiration, and
this encourages the reader to look for some deeper
meaning in the rest of the book. The story as
interpreted by critical methods is that Jonah is
the nation of Israel, chosen to be a missionary
nation to the heathen. On refusing the task which
Divine selection had marked out for her she is thrown
into exile, and has been restored for the purpose of
carrying out her original mission. This is here symbolised
by the whale swallowing Jonah, who on being
cast up proceeded on his neglected commission,
though still with little love for his work. The imagery
is crude and may strike the reader as exceedingly
improbable, until his attention is drawn to the fact that
the whale or sea-monster plays a great part in Old Testament
imagery and is once actually used as a symbol
of the Exile. "Nebuchadrezzar the King of Babylon
hath devoured me, ... he hath swallowed me up like a
dragon, ... he hath cast me out.... I will do
judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring
out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up"
(Jer. li. 34, 44). With this interpretation as a clue,
the book becomes luminous. It is an apology for
the Gentiles who are shown to be capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
repentance; Israel is blamed for her grudging estimate
of the heathen, for her refusal to convey to them
the light which she enjoyed, and for her fear lest
others should share the favour of Jehovah. Perhaps
the symbolic character of the book was adopted,
because the author knew that if such truths were
boldly stated they would never be received by his
age; and so he hoped that the truth might enter in
through an interesting story of wonder and adventure.
It can hardly be claimed that the author
has been successful; for the Jews resisted the
universalism of the Son of Man and the propagandist
methods of the Apostle Paul, while Christendom has
been far more concerned in proving that a whale can
swallow a man, than in carrying out the command
to evangelise those who know not their right hand
from their left.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WORK OF THE PRIESTS</span></h3>

<p>We have seen that the Exile produced two
important prophetical works. The one is a vision
of a restored Jewish state, contemplated under the
guise of a Church rather than as a Nation; the work
of the priestly Prophet Ezekiel. The other is incorporated
in the second half of the prophecies ascribed
to Isaiah; the author is unknown, but the work is an
attempt to interpret the calamitous history of the
Exile in such a fashion that the nation might be led
to take as its ideal for the future, the Servant of
Jehovah, the bearer of light to the nations of the
world. The outlook in these two works is entirely
different, yet both seem to have called forth a school
which endeavoured to work out their ideals, but the
school of Ezekiel obtained a more immediate recognition
and exerted the greater influence on the nation.
For the first time in Israel's history a prophet is
found who is concerned with matters of ritual,
the regulation of a priesthood, and the details of
ecclesiasticism. Ezekiel endeavoured to secure the
reforms demanded by the Prophets, not only by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
effect of his own preaching, but by the formation of
definite organisations and the establishment of certain
customs. The priestly school which followed Ezekiel
and developed his conceptions, possessed sufficient
prestige to persuade the nation that their scheme
was of Divine authority. Their work was carried on
during and after the Exile, but with the exception
of Ezra, the names of the authors have not been
preserved. In the Bible history their work suddenly
appears under the name of "the law of Moses" in
444 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The first certain mention of the recognition
and observance of this law is found in Nehemiah
(viii.), where a memorable scene is described. Ezra
the Scribe, "the writer of the words of the commandments
of the Lord and of his statutes to Israel"
(Ezra vii. 11), has come from Babylon, bringing
with him the law of Moses. The people are gathered
together on a certain day, and from morning to noon,
the law is read in their hearing, with such comments
and explanations as seemed necessary. The immediate
result of this publication was the discovery
that important provisions had been neglected and
commands very seriously transgressed, and there
followed such grief and alarm among those who
listened, that it was difficult for the authorities to
persuade the people to abandon their mourning and
rejoice in the fact that the law had now been made
known to them. On the morrow a further reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
took place, when they discovered that on that very
day they ought to be keeping a feast of tabernacles.
The feast was therefore observed for the appointed
time of eight days, and it is expressly noted that this
had not been done since the time of Joshua. Other
reforms were immediately set in motion; marriage
with those not of pure Jewish blood was not only
forbidden but, where such had actually been contracted,
an immediate dissolution was enforced; a
tax of one third of a shekel was levied for the upkeep
of the Temple Services, and the law of the Sabbath
was rigorously enforced. Now this picture was not
written by a contemporary, and critics have found
such difficulty in discovering the exact historical
facts that considerable doubt has been aroused, not
only concerning the historicity of this event, but even
concerning the existence of Ezra himself. But it is
certain that in the Fifth Century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, laws were
obeyed and institutions were recognised, of which we
have no record, outside the Pentateuch, in the
earlier historical books. The question to be answered
is: What was that "law of Moses" which Ezra
brought to Jerusalem and read to the people? Later
Judaism calls the first five books of the Bible "the
Law of Moses," and for centuries both Jewish and
Christian scholars have identified Ezra's law with
these books, have supposed that they existed from
the time of Moses downwards, but were entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
neglected by the Jews until this time. Modern
research is compelled to dissent altogether from this
tradition. Our purpose in this book prevents us
from discussing the details of this controversy, but
in addition to what has been already said in an
earlier lecture, the main results of critical study on
the origin of the Law may be outlined.</p>

<p>From the time occupied by Ezra in reading his
law it is inferred that it could hardly have been our
first five books of the Bible; and since to carry out
the laws contained in them would involve endless
discussion because of their contradictory character
(compare for example the directions for keeping the
feast of Tabernacles in Deut. xvi. 13, 15, which
commands seven days, with Lev. xxiii. 39, which
adds an eighth day for a solemn assembly; compare
also the account in 1 Kings viii. 66, with 2 Chron.
vii. 8, 10), it is thought that this law of Ezra must
have been much smaller than the Pentateuch, and
much more homogeneous. The Pentateuch not only
contains more than "laws," but even the legal
sections bear the marks of such widely different aims
and conditions that we are compelled to assume a
gradual collection, with continual redaction and
codification, in order to account for the various
phenomena. The earliest strata may go back to a
great antiquity, and the customs themselves must
often be primitive Semitic survivals, but the critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
contention is that, as a whole, the "Law of Moses"
owes its present form to an age later than the Exile,
and somewhat later than Ezra himself; for Ezra's
code has itself been revised (compare Neh. x. 32,
where a third of a shekel is appointed, with Exod.
xxx. 13, where it has increased to half a shekel),
before it was amalgamated with the Pentateuch in
its existing form.</p>

<p>The critical basis for this theory of the gradual
formation of the law is found first in the fact that the
legislation of the Pentateuch is not homogeneous: it
is so contradictory that to carry out the law as it
stands would be found impossible. It is claimed
that the presence of the various strata can be detected
by the numerous repetitions (<i>e.g.</i>, the commandments
exist in three recensions: Exod. xx. 1&ndash;17; xxxiv.
17&ndash;28; Deut. v. 6&ndash;21); by the use of different names
for God, by the difference in language and style, and
by the change in theological conceptions; and moreover,
that these different strata can be roughly
assigned to various ages, which can be actually confirmed
by the record of their observance in the
historical books (compare the provisions made for
the Ark in Exod. xxv.-xl.; Num. iii.-iv., with its
actual treatment in 1 Sam.).</p>

<p>The different strata of the laws, and the ages to
which they may be roughly assigned, are as follows:&mdash;The
earliest code of laws is said to be that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
"Book of the Covenant" (Exod. xxiv. 7), found in
Exod. xx. 20&ndash;xxiii. 33. The primitive character of
this code can be discerned, by the comparison of its
directions for worship with those of later ages. It
sanctioned the erection of rude altars at any place
where Jehovah had been revealed, whereas in later
codes no place except the one chosen spot can be
used for worship, and the altar must be of highly
specialised construction (compare Exod. xx. 24&ndash;26
and Deut. xii. 4&ndash;24, with Exod. xxvii. 1&ndash;8). Now
it is precisely this informal worship, which could be
performed by any one and at any place, that appears
to have been the custom until the time of the reformation
under Josiah; and in his times, and as the
cause of his reform, the critics place the Book of
Deuteronomy, v.-xxvi.; for it presupposes the
teaching of the prophets and is the programme
followed by Josiah. Then next follows "the Law
of Holiness" (Lev. xvii.-xxvi.); which is either the
outcome of Ezekiel's work or is shortly prior to it;
anyhow, the connection is close. Then in 444 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
appears the code of Ezra, which was afterwards
developed and set in a brief narrative describing the
historical preparation for the law and its actual
deliverance by Moses; this document of history and
laws is known for convenience as the Priestly Code,
and is denoted by the letter "P." The editorial
framework of the completed Hexateuch (the first six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
books of the Bible), is of the same stamp as the
Priests' Code, and the date of its final compilation
must not be put very much later than Ezra, since
the Samaritan Pentateuch probably goes back to the
Fourth Century, from which date it can claim an
independent existence. It is this work of the Priests
that we are now to examine. "P" is to be found at
present scattered throughout the Hexateuch, and
embraces nearly the whole of Leviticus, Numbers
and a good portion of Exodus; is found in many
scattered passages in Genesis and in a small portion
of Joshua and Judges, especially, in the latter case,
in the closing chapters; there is only a very little
in Deuteronomy. Although not the work of one
hand, these passages can be detected by their unity
of motive, the uniform phraseology, the priestly
outlook, and their concern with legal and ritualistic
regulations. The style is stereotyped, measured,
and prosaic, and is rendered somewhat monotonous
by the repetition of stated formulae. The theological
ideas are dominated by the thought of the awful
holiness of God and the danger that there lies in
approaching Him in any other than the ordained way.</p>

<p>What were the sources from which this code drew
its material? It is not suggested that the code was
simply <i>invented</i> during the Exile. Many of the legal
commands concerning uncleanness, leprosy, and
marriage are really ancient customs, and only owed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
their <i>codification</i> to this late age; for they reflect a
low stage of culture, and their rites of purification
are primitive. Again sacrifice had been performed
as far back as Semitic history can be traced, and
customs which had persisted were now simply
tabulated and their form fixed. Many of the
sacrificial rites prescribed in the code still bear the
marks of their early origin, especially in the case of the
burnt and the peace-offerings, but the law of the sin-offering
shows artificial elaboration. Undoubtedly
when Solomon's Temple was built a new sacrificial
ritual would be developed more in keeping with the
splendour of the edifice, and as the Temple increased
in prestige, and when under Isaiah's influence it
became the one spot at which sacrifice could be
performed, the priestly caste would keep the rite in
their own hands and perform it with more care; and
all this would become the basis for a new ritualistic
legislation. The minuteness of the Priestly Code
often gives the impression of a record of exact
history, but a careful examination of such measurements
as are given in the case of the Ark or the
Tabernacle do not confirm the historical accuracy;
for the Tabernacle cannot be made exactly as
described, and if it could be, would neither stand
up, nor be suitable for the purpose for which it
was intended, nor be able to be transported through
the desert. It is simply a tent-like model of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Temple projected into the early history on the theory
that the worship which existed in the writer's time
was that which had always existed. The artificial
conception of the history which "P" follows can of
course be seen, if we separate the various strata of
the first six books in the Bible, but it can be seen
without this difficult and controversial method by
comparing the history of Kings with Chronicles: the
one written largely before and the other entirely
after the legislation of "P" had been accepted. The
law of the Day of Atonement is almost entirely late,
and originated in the deepened sense of guilt produced
during the Exile; neither is there any trace of its
observance until that time.</p>

<p>A difficult question has arisen concerning the date
of this legislation since the discovery of the Code of
Hammurabi. Hammurabi was a Babylonian king
who lived somewhere about 2,250 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and who
has been identified by some with the Amraphael of
Gen. xiv. His code reveals a fairly advanced stage of
civilisation and morality existing in Babylon at that
time, but its chief interest for us is found in the fact
that many of the laws concerning common life,
marriage, etc., are not only like the laws of the Bible,
but in some cases are verbally similar. This phenomenon
demands some theory of contact between
the two codes, but no theory has yet been found
that explains all the facts. The idea of direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
borrowing on either side can hardly be taken seriously,
and the correspondence between the two codes hardly
requires that; so that the question is narrowed to
one of influence. This influence would seem to be
most natural in the time of the Exile, were it not
that the strictly exclusive spirit then developed by
the Jews makes it unthinkable. There remains
either the explanation of a common basis for the two
codes, traceable to their Semitic origin, or what has
received the greater support from scholars, the idea
that the influence of Hammurabi's laws on Israel's
legislation is to be traced through the former inhabitants
of Canaan. To understand how this is possible,
we must remember that it is now known that Babylon
had predominating influence over Western Palestine
before the conquest of Canaan by the Hebrews;
that the inhabitants of the land were much more
civilised than their conquerors; and that the invaders
did not exterminate the inhabitants, but quietly
effected a settlement among them and adopted many
of their customs.</p>

<p>While on the subject of the influence of Babylon
it will be convenient to notice here that this
influence is not confined to legal matters, but can be
traced in certain legendary elements in the Old
Testament. The ideal of the Priests' Code would
not tolerate heathen mythology that could be
detected as such, to appear in its work, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
there are definite traces of such mythology to be
found in "P"s account of the creation in Gen. i.
The discovery of the libraries of Assurbanipal has
brought to light records of a mythological cosmogony
which, while utterly different in conception and
spirit from Genesis, is sufficiently similar to suggest
some degree of connection. This Babylonian Epic
of creation deals not so much with the remarkably
scientific idea of a gradual creation of our earth out
of chaotic materials, but with a conflict of gods and
monsters which is supposed to have taken place
before the creation. In the opening verses of the
Bible there is a reference to the partition of the
deep, which is here called by the non-Hebrew name
<i>Tehom</i>, into two parts: the waters above and the
waters under the firmament. Now in the Babylonian
story the actual creation of the earth is preceded by
a mighty struggle between <i>Marduk</i>, the sun-god
(the Merodach of the Bible) and a great dragon
symbolical of the primeval waters, which bears the
name <i>Tiamat</i>, the Babylonian form of <i>Tehom</i>. The
influence of this myth is the more certainly to be
traced in Genesis, because it appears elsewhere in
the Old Testament under the form of a legend of a
conflict between Jehovah and Rahab, a mighty
dragon; and this legend is generally in some way
connected with creation (Job ix. 13; xxvi. 12;
Isa. li. 9; Ps. lxxxix. 10). There is also a Babylonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
story of the flood which keeps even closer to the
Bible narrative, and it may be seen from the Babylonian
version that this is more probably another
form of the dragon myth than a common memory of
a tremendous deluge. A Babylonian seal cylinder in
the British Museum bears the picture of a man and
woman standing one on each side of a sacred tree,
from which they are picking fruit, while a serpent coils
around the tree; but no written explanation of this
very suggestive picture has been discovered. These
mythical stories have come down from primitive
Semitic times, but we cannot fail to notice that while
their ancestry is undoubtedly common, there is a
tremendous difference between the stage reached
under the inspiration of the Hebrew genius and the
crude Polytheism of the Babylonian stories. Their
connection in some way is unmistakable, but still
more certain is their different ethical and religious
level. The fact of the borrowing does not deny the
inspiration; it rather reveals how powerful that
inspiration was.</p>

<p>To turn now to a consideration of the work of the
Priests. We must doubtless concede to the workers
a very lofty motive: it was nothing less than an
endeavour to include the whole of the nation's life
under the conception that God was dwelling among
His people, and that the nation must be holy because
He is holy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
But in the working out of this purpose the ideal is
neither secured nor maintained. The holiness of
God is insisted on with much reiteration, but it is
conceived of as a physical rather than a moral
attribute. It is really only a conception of the
unapproachability of God unless certain purely ritual
and physical conditions are observed. For the
enforcement of this idea the old custom of sacrifice
was elaborated and strictly defined, but strangely
enough, without explicit teaching as to its meaning.
This is peculiar, and it seems to have remained
largely unnoticed, for many Biblical expositors have
adopted without inquiry the idea that the sacrifices
were substitutionary, piacular, and typical of the
sacrifice of Christ. The piacular meaning suggests
itself at so many points that it is startling to find
that it cannot be borne out by careful examination.
The sacrifices are in most instances only efficacious
for the forgiveness of unintentional sins, or
for the atonement of ritualistic mistakes made in
ignorance or through inadvertence. The ceremony
of laying the hands of the offerer on the head of
the intended victim, suggests that a symbolical
transference of guilt is taking place, and yet only in
one case is this accompanied by a confession of sins,
and there the victim is not slain, but led away for
Azazel. The sin-offering involved the death of the
animal, but an animal was not absolutely necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
for the purpose, and flour might be substituted; and
even where we have the slain animal, the idea that
the animal has taken the place of the sinner seems to
be excluded by the fact that its flesh is regarded as
"most holy." The offerings are said to make atonement,
but we are not told how this is affected unless
in the passage that states that "it is the blood that
maketh atonement, by reason of the life." The
word translated "atonement" means simply "a
covering," and of course may mean that the blood,
which is symbolical of the offered life, either covers
the eyes of God from beholding the sin, or covers the
sinner. We are left then, either with the deduction
that the exact significance of the sacrifices was not
mentioned because everyone knew what it was, or
that it has not been told because it was too mysterious,
or that there was no definite meaning attached to
them. Originally sacrifice did not bear a piacular
significance, but it would be unsafe to argue from
this that no substitutionary value was attached to
the Levitical sacrifices by these priestly lawyers;
indeed the only safe conclusion seems to be that the
priests adopted these sacrifices, which were time-honoured,
as the proper ritual for the approach to
God, without any definite inquiry as to their
meaning. But taking the Levitical system as a
whole there seems to underlie it the theory of
symbolical, although not piacular substitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
God owns man entirely, and that by right: his time,
possessions, flocks, and lands; and demands from
him the completest recognition of this ownership.
Now in practice, this absolute demand can only be
recognised by substitute and proxy; and so we have
the recognition of God's claims by the observance of
one holy day in seven, by the ransom of the first-born,
by the sabbatical and jubilee years, by the tithes,
and especially by the sacrifices. His dwelling in the
land is symbolised by the respect paid to one
symbolical holy place; and the continual service He
demands is represented by the daily service carried
on by the Levitical caste. But even if this be the
intention of the system, it is nowhere so defined,
and therefore it is not surprising to find that people
soon forgot the symbolical meaning, and treated the
symbol as a thing sufficient in itself; with the result,
that the service of God came to be restricted to a
performance of rites that had lost all significance.
One explanation would soon silence any criticism
of this scheme that might arise, namely, that God
had so ordained that men should worship Him. But
deeper still there lay a radical misconception of the
very nature of God and of the service He seeks.
God was conceived as inimical not so much to man's
sin, as to man himself; and this danger was averted
by the use of protective rites which needed to be
performed with scrupulous care, lest a mistake might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
bring down on the worshipper immediate and awful
destruction, quite irrespective of his moral condition.
Doubtless the nation might be impressed by these
means with the awful aloofness of God, and there
must often have accompanied this some notion of the
ethical character that was expressed in this separateness;
but the means taken for satisfying this
character and demand in the nature of God could
never have had any other result than it did, namely,
the conception that attention to details of ritual could
be a substitute for the much more difficult service of
repentance and righteousness. It is possible that
we may be under-estimating the real motive of the
Priests' work and its actual success in preserving
religion under these forms; but the radical evil is
clearly exposed when we come to the time of another
calamity, that which befel the nation under Antiochus
Epiphanes, when no other method of averting the
anger of God seems to have been thought of, except
that of increasing the rigour of this ritual law and
fencing it round with still further restrictions, until
it became a burden too heavy to be borne.</p>

<p>Such a régime utterly failed to understand the
teaching of Jesus and could only regard His religion
as impious and lacking in all that was essential,
reverential, or good, and it was "the Law" which
put Jesus to death. It is much to be deplored that
the Sacrifice of Christ has in turn been explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
to the conscience touched to penitence and tenderness
by the story of the Cross, rather by the analogy
of the Old Testament sacrifices than by its complete
superiority to them as based upon a different and
ethical order; for the rags and tatters of the Levitical
system still impede the religious life; allowing men
to think that God is content with substitutes, can
be placated with blood, and is more concerned with
abstract regulations than with moral change. And
so there still hang about religion the same inconsistencies,
the same slaughter of the prophets, the
same blindness to the eternal demands of personal
and social righteousness. The motive of the work
of the Priests may have been to enforce the prophetic
repentance, but to gain this end they compromised
with unspiritual ritual, and on that compromise
Christ was, and is still crucified.</p>

<p>Titles of the Psalms, descriptive of their <span class="locked">contents:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Song, Heb. <i>Shirah.</i> A lyrical poem for singing. Probably the
earliest title, which in some instances may have belonged to the original
composition.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Michtam</i>, perhaps, "a golden piece." The title indicates their
artistic form and choice contents. They were probably all taken from
a previous collection.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Maschil</i>, a meditative poem, from a collection made perhaps in
the late Persian period.</p>

<p>(4) Psalm, Heb. <i>Mizmor</i>. The name given to a collection used for
public worship, probably in the early Greek period.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Shiggaion</i>, (Ps. vii.; also in plural, Hab. iii. 1.) Some take
this to mean a wild, passionate composition, but this Psalm hardly
bears that character. Perhaps we may expect a textual corruption
from <i>Neginah</i>: a song accompanied with musical instruments.</p>

<p>(6) A song of Ascents: used in the processions to the Temple.</p>

<p>(7) A prayer.</p>

<p>On the question of the Davidic authorship of the Psalms, the
following passages should be examined; they would appear to be in
hopeless disagreement with the life of David as depicted in the historical
books. Ps. v. 8&ndash;10; vi. 7, f.; xii. 1&ndash;4; xvii. 9&ndash;14; xxii.; xxvii.
10, 12; xxxv. 11&ndash;21; xli. 5&ndash;9; liv. 2&ndash;6; lxii. 3, f. The Psalms
which are ascribed to some definite occasion in David's life are not on
the whole any more suitable to the situation, although there is generally
some single phrase which probably gave rise to this identification.</p>

<p>The great commentator Ewald, on literary grounds ascribed the
following Psalms to David because of their originality and dignified
spirit: Ps. iii.; iv.; vii.; viii.; xi.; xv.; xviii.; xix. 1&ndash;6; xxiv.

put as far back as the Early Monarchy, Ps. vii., xiii., xviii., xxiii.,

<span class="subhead">THE RELIGION OF THE PSALMISTS</span></h3>

<p>The principles of Biblical criticism have often
been traced to a vigorous application of the theory
of evolution to the growth of religious ideas. Such
an application, if without the support of facts, would
discredit all critical results; but as a matter of fact,
the critical readjustment of the Old Testament does
not give a perfect progression in religious development.
Indeed, it leaves us with a perplexing story
of decline from high attainment. The Law follows
the Prophets, and no theory can recognise the Law
as an advance upon prophetic teaching. The national
rejection of the Prophets is the central tragedy of
Hebrew history and prepares us for the national
rejection of Jesus. Yet between the Prophets and
the religion of the Gospels we are able to trace an
almost continuous link in the religion of the
Psalmists. This connection is somewhat obscured
by the early date assigned to the Psalms by
uncritical tradition, by the heterogeneous character
of the collection, and by its continual redaction in
the interest of the purpose to which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
adapted. In adopting this collection of religious
poems for the purpose of public praise, it is more
than likely that additions were made, in order that
they might more fitly express the need of the time,
while reverence for the writings, by the time at least,
of the final edition of the work, operated to preserve
the original; as may be seen, for instance, in the
addition made to the fifty-first Psalm (ver. 18, 19),
which in its original form condemns the very worship
in which it was used. Moreover the collection is as
much a prayer-book as a hymn-book, for many of
the Psalms are really prayers, and five of them are
actually so entitled. The book was certainly used
in the Temple services, but on the whole it must have
seemed more fitted for the non-sacrificial and non-ceremonial
worship of the synagogue, or for the
private devotions of pious men and women. However
and wherever used, it must have nourished a
deep personal religion and kept alive hopes to which
Christianity afterwards appealed.</p>

<p>No other single book of the Old Testament has
had such an influence on Christian piety and worship.
From ancient times to the present day the Psalms
have been chanted, and in Churches of widely
differing ritual they have been considered the only
fit vehicle for Christian praise.</p>

<p>Nothing more clearly demonstrates their proximity
to the Christian view of things, although the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
spirit in Christendom is finding it increasingly
difficult to express itself in the language of all the
Psalms, on account of their imprecatory wishes.
Perhaps still more, the predominant tone of the
book, which is one of crying for deliverance from
overwhelming enemies and oppression, hardly suits
the safety of our times, or meets the demand for a
joyful religious spirit. Many of the Psalms become
real only in times of severe spiritual trial, and where
there exists a deep sense of contrition; still better
do they express the emotions which arise in times of
national calamity or religious persecution; and most
of all when men are constrained to take arms in the
cause of religion and righteousness. They have never
sounded so fitting as on the lips of the Reformers,
Cromwell's Ironsides, or the Scottish Covenanters.
And yet their great breadth of appeal, their touching
of every possible note in religious experience&mdash;penitence
and joy, questioning and trust, longing and
satisfaction, defeat and victory,&mdash;their majestic
literary form, and their poetic inspiration will
preserve them for ever as sublime utterances of
universal religion. But our work is not to appraise
their eternal value, but to estimate their significance,
influence, and position in the development of Old
Testament religion; and to do this we must endeavour
to trace the origin and compilation of the Psalter.</p>

<p>The criticism of the Psalter is faced by a peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
difficult and complex problem, arising from the lack
of historic connection, the possible obliteration by
editorial redaction, and the difficulty of interpreting
with certainty even those data which the text
presents, and it has by no means yet reached settled
conclusions; only general and tentative results can
be noted here. That, however, the book is the result
of a gradual process, may be seen from the presence
of doublets (liii. = xiv.; lxx. = xl. 13&ndash;17; cviii. = lvii.
7&ndash;11 + lx. 5&ndash;12), and from the subscription at the
end of Book II., which displays ignorance of the
fact that further Psalms, ascribed to David follow.
It will be more convenient to start from the final
position and work backward; and that final position
is undoubtedly this, that the Book of Psalms as it
stands in our Bible is the hymn-book of the restored
Second Temple. It is a book prepared for musical
accompaniment; this may be seen from the titles
still preserved at the head of many of the Psalms.
These titles are of three kinds: they describe the
nature of the poetic composition; they give the
names of the authors and sometimes the circumstances
in which they were composed; and the third
kind are most probably to be explained as instructions
for musical setting. These last-named titles are in
most cases very obscure; the Revised Version has
simply transliterated the Hebrew words. On the
assumption that these are musical terms, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
three classes of them in the Psalms. One class
apparently gives directions for the tune to which
the Psalm is to be sung, and this tune is named,
like some modern hymn tunes, after the words with
which the tune had been originally or customarily
associated; these appear to have been popular songs,
not necessarily of an entirely religious character
(Ps. lvi., R.V. title: "set to Jonath elem rehokim";
mar. translates: "The silent dove of them that are
afar off"; Ps. lvii., lviii.: "set to Al tashheth,"
which means: "Do not destroy." In the Septuagint
the setting of Ps. lxx. has been altered to: "Save
me, O Lord"). Other titles seem to direct the
voice to be used in singing, as either falsetto or bass
(Ps. xlvi., "set to Alamoth"; probably maiden-like
voices, and as women took no part in the service of
the choirs, this must refer either to tenor, or male
falsetto; Ps. vi., xii., "set to the Sheminith."
R.V. mar., "the eighth." This is probably the
octave or bass voice). Two references are to be
found to the instrumental accompaniment to be
used, as either stringed or wind instruments (Ps. iv.,
vi., etc., "on stringed instruments"; Ps. v., "with
the Nehiloth," mar., "wind instruments"). The
much discussed meaning of <i>Selah</i> is most probably
to be sought in a musical direction. The word
means: "lift up." The Septuagint translates, "interlude,"
but many other versions (Version of Aquila,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Syriac Peshitto, Jerome and the Targum) translate,
"for ever." This duplicate translation suggests the
very possible clue that at the places where <i>Selah</i>
appears, the Psalm might be ended, if desired, and
the "for ever," or the doxology, which was usually
sung at the end of the Psalm and which is found at
the end of each book, could be taken there. As
completed, the Psalter is therefore a book with
directions for a fully organised and choral worship,
and we have to seek for a time when such a worship
was in existence. The difficulty is that these musical
directions are somewhat rare and are not found in
the later books, but only in connection with those
Psalms entitled, "for the Director." As the instruments
mentioned are only of the simplest kind and
not of the varied character used in the ornate
worship of the Temple (cxlix. 3; cl. 3&ndash;5), and as by
the time the Greek translation was made (150 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>),
their significance was forgotten, we have to put the
final edition long after the founding of synagogue
worship, in which the Director's Psalm Book was
first used, and at some period when there had been a
complete change in musical practice. This demands
a time when Hellenistic culture had moulded even
the Temple worship. (The Jews were under Greek
influence and rule from <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 333 to <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 63.) The
time from which a full choral service was in use in
the Temple is to be carried back, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Chronicler, to the time of Solomon and David, but
a comparison with the earlier history contained in
the Books of the Kings does not confirm this.
The Chronicler, who from his interest in these
matters seems to have been a member of one of the
Levite choirs, really gives us the customs current
in his times, and infers that they went back
unchanged to the time of the building of the first
Temple and to the preparatory work of David.
These considerations, together with the admitted
lateness of many of the Psalms, some of them
undoubtedly belonging to the times of the Maccabæan
wars, bring us down to that late age and perhaps
more precisely to the time of the rededicated Temple
(165 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), and demand that the final edition of the
Psalter is to be placed somewhere about 150 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We might expect to find traces of the growth of the
Psalter in the division into five books (at xli., lxxii.,
cvi., cl., see R. V.), but there seems no real division
necessary between Books IV. and V. and the five-fold
division may be due to the desire to imitate the divisions
of the Law; the other divisions however contain
more hopeful suggestions. The first book, for instance,
is almost entirely ascribed to David (Ps. i. is an
introduction to the whole book, composed for the
final edition, and Ps. ii. may have been also placed
in front as part of the introduction. Ps. xxxiii., which
is very late, may have been added as a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
doxology to Ps. xxxii. The rest are ascribed to David).
The second book is largely Davidic and it concludes
with the statement: "the prayers of David the son
of Jesse are ended." In spite of this notice Psalms
are found ascribed to David in the books that follow,
so that the remark must have been found appended
to a collection that the final editor took over; it
cannot be due to his own hand. Further evidence
of compilation is to be found in the strange occurrence
of the different names for God: Elohim and
Jehovah. In the first book the name of Jehovah
preponderates. In Book II. the name Elohim is
found most frequently. Then in Book III. Psalms
lxxiii.-lxxxiii. use Elohim only, and lxxxiv.-lxxxix.
Jehovah mainly; and in practically the whole of Books
IV. and V. Jehovah is almost solely used, The
reason for this phenomenon must be sought in
editorial redaction, for in the duplicate Psalms, xiv.
and liii., xl. 13&ndash;17 and lxx., Jehovah is found in the
first recension and Elohim in the second. The
Elohistic character of lxxiii.-lxxxiii. may be due to
the original compiler since they are all ascribed to
Asaph and otherwise bear marks of common production.
The Elohistic redaction may have been made
in a period when the name Jehovah sounded tribal
and almost heathenish; but a similar test leads to
the conclusion that the first collection enjoyed by
this time a liturgical familiarity, which did not permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
of alteration. The reversion to the name of Jehovah
in Books IV. and V. might be explained by the fact
that in later times the name was written but never
pronounced. On the line of these suggestions we
should expect to find that Book I. contained the
earliest Psalms and Books IV. and V. the latest; this
is roughly correct, if we allow for the possibility of
minor insertions being made for various purposes in the
last edition. In Book V. there is a group of Psalms
(civ.-cvi., cxi.-cxiii., cxv.-cxvii., cxxxv., cxlvi.-cl.),
which are distinguished by either commencing
or ending with "Hallelujah," and are known as the
"Hallels." From their contents, it may be observed
that they are suitable for use at the Great Festivals,
and it is known that they were, and are still so used
by the Jews. They imply a highly organised musical
service (Ps. cl.), they require a time when the festivals
were regularly observed and when the worship of the
Temple could be carried on without fear. Such conditions
are to be found together only after the Exile,
and then only during the period of Greek rule; and
to this late period the composition of these Psalms is
to be referred. An even later date is demanded for
some Psalms that are said to reflect the rebellion
against the Hellenizing movement enforced by
Antiochus Epiphanes, in which the Maccabees played
such a heroic part. This date is confirmed by the
references to: the "assembly of the saints" (Ps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
cxlix. 1, Heb. <i>hasidim</i>, the purist party formed in
that time); the cruel persecution for religious
opinions (Ps. xliv. 17&ndash;22; lxxix. 2; lxxxiii. 3, 4); the
defiling of the Temple, the burning of the synagogues,
and the silence of the Prophetic voice (Ps. lxxiv. 7&ndash;9;
lxxix. 1). Other Maccabæan Psalms are said to be:
cx., where there is a reference to some priest who is
not in the legitimate succession, which entirely describes
the Priest-Kings of the Maccabæan dynasty
(other scholars would put this Psalm very early; on
the other hand there are alleged traces of an acrostic
that would spell Simon, the first of the Maccabæan
Priest-Kings); cxv. cxviii., which celebrate successful
wars in which the leaders have been the house of
Aaron, to which house the Maccabees of course
belonged. This is the latest date that is demanded
for any of the Psalms, and in the present condition
of criticism we can only say that between this and
some earlier period the book is to be placed. It
must now be our task to discover the earliest date that
any of the Psalms demand. We have seen that
Book I. seems to be the earliest collection, and tradition
assumes that this was the work of David and
was the Psalm Book used in the First Temple. To
discuss this point it is necessary to enquire into the
reliability of the titles that ascribe the Psalms to
definite authors. These titles give: one each to
Moses, Ethan, and Heman; two to Solomon; eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
to the Sons of Korah; twelve to Asaph; and seventy-three
to David (it is doubtful whether Jeduthun is a
person; if so he is probably the same as Ethan: Ps.
xxxix., lxii., lxxvii., titles; cp. 1 Chron. vi. 44 with
1 Chron. ix. 16). Now it should be noticed that none
of the authors are later than Solomon (Ethan,
1 Kings iv. 31, 1 Chron. vi. 44; Heman, 1 Kings iv.
31, 1 Chron. vi. 33, xv. 17, 19, xxv. 5; Asaph, 1 Chron.
vi. 39, xxv. 1f, Neh. xii. 46; in Ezra ii. 41, Neh. vii. 44,
Asaph seems to mean a guild of singers rather than
an individual). If any of the Psalms ascribed to
authors might be expected to yield confirmation by
internal evidence, it would be Ps. xc.; but there is
nothing in its language or thought that points to
extreme antiquity. There is also nothing in the
Psalms themselves that confirms the authorship of the
contemporaries of Solomon, Ethan and Heman. The
title of Ps. cxxvii., "of Solomon," is missing in the
Septuagint and is evidently a late gloss, and the title
of Ps. lxxii. is translated in the Septuagint: "a psalm
<i>for</i> Solomon," which certainly describes the contents
better. The Psalms ascribed to the Sons of Korah
(xlii.-xlix., lxxxiv., lxxxv., lxxxvii., lxxxviii.; 2 Chron.
xx. 19, 1 Chron. xxvi. 19; but 1 Chron. vi. 33&ndash;38
shows that Kohathite and Korahite are the same), have
common features, as have also the Psalms ascribed to
Asaph, which imply that they are at least guild
collections; but their exalted conception of God, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
consciousness of national righteousness, the reference
to synagogue worship and the cessation of prophecy
(lxxiv. 8f) point to a time subsequent to Ezra.</p>

<p>The chief interest of the titles is found in the
ascription of so many Psalms to David. It was
long thought that David was not only the author of
the Psalms ascribed to him, but that he was also
editor of the entire Psalter. (When as early as
Theodore of Mopsuestia it was recognised that some
of the Psalms were Maccabæan, it was supposed that
David wrote them in the spirit of prophecy.) Our
enquiry may be narrowed down to those Psalms
that are ascribed to David in the earliest collection,
Book I. Do these reflect the conditions and development
of his times? It must be replied that there is
nothing in the Davidic Psalms as a whole to
distinguish them from other Psalms, and what
historical connection they betray seems everywhere
to belong to an age later than David. The Temple
is spoken of as already in existence (Ps. v. 7; xi. 4)
and the name for Jerusalem, "my holy hill," seems
to demand a time subsequent to the mission of
Isaiah. The general conditions of life reflected are
clearly those in which a godly minority is oppressed
and wickedness is established in the land; a condition
which finds no parallel in the Books of
Samuel. Moreover, the religious ideas are far in
advance of those that seem to have been prevalent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the time of David or that can be traced to him.
The general tone of the Psalms is one of a chastened
piety that hardly existed in the time of the kingdom,
and the religious ideas everywhere show dependence
upon the teaching of the Prophets. There is hardly
a verse of the fifty-first Psalm which cannot be
paralleled in Jeremiah, but there is almost nothing
in the Psalm that makes it a fitting confession for
an adulterer and murderer. These considerations
lead us to enquire whether the Hebrew preposition
translated "of" David denotes authorship; its
accurate signification is "belonging to," and from
the analogy of the other titles we infer this to mean
that the editor found these Psalms in a collection
ascribed to David. What gave the name of David
to that collection? Some of the Psalms may
be pre-exilic and may even go down to the
early monarchy; Ps. xx. may belong to the Old
Kingdom, but it can hardly have come from the
lips of David; it is Ps. xviii. that has perhaps
the greatest claim to Davidic authorship. This
Psalm is also found in 2 Sam. xxii., but there it
seems to be an interpolation, for it breaks apart
verses that apparently once stood together (2 Sam.
xxi. 22 and xxiii. 8). Yet we meet with a reference
to the Temple even in this Psalm (2 Sam.
xxi. 7); at the same time several of its passages
would come very fittingly from the Warrior King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
and would be suitable to his barbarous times. In
this Psalm, if anywhere, we may possess some
original Davidic fragments. We must conclude
therefore, that the Davidic Psalter was so called
because its origin was somehow due to David, or
because it contained some Song of David which
must have been considerably altered to suit liturgical
purposes. The early tradition of David ascribes to
him a poetic and musical gift (1 Sam. xvi. 18;
Amos. vi. 5), and of this the lament over Saul and
Jonathan (2 Sam. i.) is a sufficient confirmation,
but it should be noticed that it is remarkably free
from any religious sentiment whatsoever. It must
be due to the later tradition of the Chronicler that
David has been credited as the saintly author of the
whole Book of Psalms. The conclusion is that the
titles are not, strictly speaking, a claim to authorship,
but are names given, for various reasons, to
pre-existing collections; that the earliest of these
collections may contain pre-exilic Psalms, but that
everything points to the collection being made for
use in the time of the Second Temple. The
references to a king do not necessitate any re-consideration
of this verdict; they may be personifications
of the nation in the light of Messianic conceptions.</p>

<p>This position has been steadily resisted by some in
the interests of tradition, but without any real religious
reason being adduced; for the idea that this decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
denies the authority of Christ and His Apostles is
disposed of by the simple fact that in the New
Testament, David is simply a name for the Psalter
(Ps. ii. is ascribed to David in Acts ii. 34; it is
anonymous in the Psalter. Heb. iv. 7 has "in"
David; this does not refer to authorship, for the
author of this Epistle never quotes the Scriptures
save anonymously). To others it will perhaps come
as a great relief to feel that the writer of some of
the most spiritual utterances of personal religion
need not be identified with the historical David.
There are awful possibilities of failure in the most
religious men, but the problem here is more difficult
than that: it would compel us to think of David as
displaying in public no hint of the secrets of his
inner religious life, but very much that contradicts
them. The traditional idea of the authorship of
the Psalms has done grave injustice to the sincere if
passionate character of the historical David. The
origin of such a tradition is due as much to the
spiritual blindness as to the careless historic judgment
of later Judaism, and its acceptance by generations
of Christian students speaks a greater reverence
for tradition than for religious insight. To be compelled
to date the great majority of the Psalms within
the period 500&ndash;150 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, is indeed a comforting
interpretation of Jewish history; for it shows that
the barren ground of post-exilic times was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
without its tender flowers of piety and an appreciation
of the prophetic religion far beyond that of the
Prophets' contemporaries. The gloss of legalism,
which can be traced in the Psalter, and which was
inevitable when these private devotions were adapted
to the Levitical worship of the Temple, has not
succeeded in obscuring, but rather brings into greater
clearness the spiritual elements in the Psalms.</p>

<p>It is welcome to turn from this task of literary
criticism, which finds in the Psalms its most difficult
field, and which perhaps yields here less help than
in other branches of Bible literature, to an endeavour
to appreciate the religion of the Psalmists. There
is difficulty here also; but now it is in the splendour
of the composition, the magnificent breadth of
experience they embrace, the classic utterance of
the eternal religion of the heart. We have recognised
the heterogeneous character of the collection, and it
is only to be expected that this should be reflected
in the variety of religious ideas. A theology of the
Psalter is as impossible as it is mistaken. The
quality of poetic genius varies, the heights of religious
inspiration sometimes reached are not consistently
maintained, and there are many lower levels. And
yet there remains a sufficient unity to leave a very
definite impression; that unity owes little to similarity
of circumstances, to contemporaneity, or to the
influence of a theological school; it is rather due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the unreflective simplicity of the human mind in
the realised presence of God. In that position all
unfettered religion speaks one tongue: the only
mother tongue of humanity. The inspiration of the
Psalmist owes its beauty to the absence of self-consciousness.
There is nothing here of the prophetic
claim to speak in the name of God; in the Psalms
God does not speak to men, men speak to God, but
it is just because of this that the revelation in the
Psalms reaches so far beyond the limits of Old
Testament religion and seems to grasp that religion
which was to be personified in the consciousness of
Jesus. We are compelled to recognise that men's
prayers are themselves a revelation of God, and that
when men seek to voice their highest aspiration we
catch the sound of a deep undertone, the supplication
of the Spirit that intercedes within.</p>

<p>As an expression of eternal religion the Psalms
have one serious defect, which really unfits them,
without careful selection, for use in Christian
worship&mdash;their awful imprecations upon enemies.
There are hardly to be found in the whole realm of
literature more fearful desires for vengeance than in
the Psalms (cix. 6&ndash;15. cxxxvii. 9; cxl. 10). To date
the Psalms from the comfortable times of the monarchy,
under the martial supremacy of David and
Solomon, is to make them cruel without meaning;
but imagine the sufferings of the Israelites in Exile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
or in the still worse times when the pious remnant
were persecuted by their own irreligious and apostate
countrymen, which was so often their lot in post-exilic
times, and these expressions can be explained,
even if they cannot be justified. The desire for
vengeance does not arise from personal motives, but
is doubtless due to the complete identification of the
Psalmist with the cause of God and righteousness,
and to his burning indignation against the cruelty,
injustice, and craftiness of the impenitent wicked.
Thus understood, there is a moral element in this anger,
which is not only to be condoned but even admired.
This deep moral revulsion has been one of the
greatest factors in moulding history along righteous
lines. But when all this has been said, it remains to
be acknowledged frankly that this is not the religion of
the Sermon on the Mount. The anger at sin is right,
but the desire for vengeance is no real cure for sin.
It is far from the deep wisdom of the Son of Man;
but we have to remember, when we judge the Psalms
from that standard, that His wisdom is still unaccepted,
not only by the world, but by many who
profess His name.</p>

<p>It is in the Psalms that personal religion receives
its clearest exposition in the Old Testament, and
this spirit owes much to the personal experience of
Jeremiah. There has been an endeavour to find the
speaking subject of the Psalms not in the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
but in the nation. There are national Psalms,
but many others cannot be successfully interpreted
save as the expressions of personal devotion.
National religion could never reach these heights; it
is bound down to the average level, it is always open
to unethical movements and ideas. The personal
element is not to be confused with the individualistic;
the personal is wider than the individual; it realises
the things that lie at the base of all human life, and
when it is most personal it speaks the most universal
language. It is in the deep sense of sin and the
assurance of forgiveness that the Psalms are the
classics for all who know the secrets they utter; and
the sense of sin can never be felt save under the
searching light of God's very presence. To be deeply
conscious of sin is the first step towards any high
revelation of God, and of this the fifty-first Psalm is
the most perfect expression; there we see the sense
of inward sin, opening up the possibility of a separation
between the self and that higher self, the holy
spirit, and bringing about the severest mental pain
and anguish. Naturally, the Psalms hardly rise to the
Christian ground of forgiveness, but the thirty-second
Psalm vibrates with the joy that the Christian knows
and, when mere figures of speech are discounted, it
springs from the same reason: the acknowledgment
of one's sin and the consciousness of its forgiveness
in the newly realised communion with God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
In dealing with the problem of the providential
order of the world, the Psalms hardly reflect any
higher conceptions than those found elsewhere in the
Old Testament, if they even rise as high as the
conception of the Second Isaiah. The idea that
goodness is rewarded by long life and prosperity, and
that wickedness is always marked by outward
disaster is the root idea; and the fact that this is not
confirmed by observation is the cause of the complaint
of many a Psalm. This problem receives no
conscious solution throughout the book. The revelation
given through the worship of the sanctuary
only shows that the prosperity of the wicked is
temporary (Ps. xxxvii., lxxiii.); but how often even
this must seem to be untrue, for in many cases there
are no bands in their death. Nothing higher is
reached than pride in one's integrity and the assurance
that somehow and somewhere retribution is
sure. There is no conception of the principle of
vicarious suffering, and the values set upon righteousness
and prosperity never attain to those words
of Jesus: "Blessed are they that have been persecuted
for righteousness sake."</p>

<p>The pressure of this problem of Providence is
supposed to have driven the Psalmists to pierce the
veil and to descry beyond the grave a compensation
for the inequalities of this life, and passages are
frequently adduced to prove this (Ps. xvi. 10, 11;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
xvii. 15; xlix., 15; lxxiii. 23&ndash;26). The current
belief of Israel embraced an existence after death,
but only in the form of unconscious and shadowy
life in the under world, <i>Sheol</i>, and this is most
explicitly expressed in many of the Psalms (vi. 5;
xxx. 9; xlix. 14; lxxxviii. 10&ndash;12). What then is the
significance of the expressions which seem to point
to something more? An accurate translation and a
correct exegesis dispose of nearly all of these passages
as in any sense explicit evidence for a definite belief
in immortality; but there remains a witness of much
greater value. It is through communion with God,
and because of the significance with which it invests
conscious life that the Psalmists are led to feel that
their experience can never be interrupted by death.
To those who know the reality of personal communion
with God, this has more cogency than any
other argument for immortality. The experience of
communion throws a new value on personality and
gives a deeper meaning to this life, and in face of
this discovery death becomes nothing more than a
passing shadow. While therefore the application of
Ps. xvi. 10 to the resurrection of Christ is foreign
to the methods of modern interpretation, that
passage does show the real significance of the
resurrection of Christ; for it is the person of Christ
in communion with God that has brought life and
immortality to light. The Psalmist shared this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
vital experience whether he was able to infer
immortality of the soul from it or not.</p>

<p>But the glory of the Psalms is found in their
realisation of the presence of God. This expresses
itself in the vivid consciousness of a present and
helpful Personality rather than in intellectual concepts
or theological definitions. The transcendence
of God receives full appreciation, but it is never in
terms of spatial distance, but in an inward realisation
of His moral excellence (Ps. xxxvi. 5&ndash;7). To the
discerning soul the presence of God is inescapable
and is absolutely omnipresent (Ps. cxxxix. 7&ndash;10).
Right alongside of the recognition of the might of
God and His holiness, there is found the sense of
His fatherly pity, His gentleness, and His understanding
of us (Ps. ciii. 13; xviii. 35).</p>

<p>It would be altogether mistaken to look in the
Psalms for that conception of Nature which has
become one of the greatest gains of modern culture.
To the Psalmist Nature has no meaning apart from
God, and it is merely the sphere of His activity. But
the beginnings of a poetic delight in things is felt
almost on every page (Ps. xxiii. 2; lv. 6; lxv. 8, 9;
xciii. 3; cvii. 24; cx. 3b; cxxiv. 5; cxxx. 6; cxxxix.
18b); while the so-called Nature Psalms (viii.,
xix., xxix., lxv., xciii., civ., cxlviii.) yield a conception of
creation and of the relation of God to the world
that has not sufficiently shaped theology, and as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
consequence has made it possible for us to think of
a conflict between religion and science.</p>

<p>The consciousness of God as of a present living
Personality is the great contribution of Hebrew
religion, and of this the Psalms are the supreme
expression. All conception of a merely unconscious,
all-pervading essence is transcended by the intense
experience of communion; He is "an ever present
help in time of trouble."</p>

<p>The Hebrew Psalmist may be a child beside the
Hindu sage or the Greek philosopher, but no one
has ever sounded the human heart as he. The
experience he has bequeathed to the world is that of
a God who is infinite, mighty and all-present, and
yet One who can be known in the experiences of
temporal life and felt in the limitations of the human
mind; One who shepherds and guides men, and who
can take the place of human friend or nearest relative.
This is in the direct line with Christ's consciousness
of the Father. Without this we may have a mysticism
that must perforce remain silent, or a philosophy
that loses itself in the endeavour to reconcile the
antinomies of thought, but without this we cannot
have a religion that can satisfy the craving of the
human heart for an infinite, holy, and helping
Companion.</p>

<p>In these examples, it might be noted, it is the friends of Job who
quote the Proverbs; except in Job xxi. 17, where Job questions the
Proverb already quoted by Bildad, rather than quotes it with approval;
and in the case of xxviii. 18, 28, the whole chapter is regarded by
critics as suspicious, on the ground that the sentiments here expressed
by Job are in contradiction to his general attitude. These passages
would seem somewhat to confirm the idea that the Book of Job is
intended to be a criticism of the theory of Providence found in
Proverbs.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RELIGION OF THE WISE</span></h3>

<p>Certain books of the Old Testament have a
marked resemblance both in their subject-matter and
in their religious and ethical outlook. They stand
out from the other classes of the literature, for they
are neither prophetical, like the writings of the
Prophets or the histories written under their influence,
nor legalistic, like the great codes of the Pentateuch,
nor liturgical and devotional, like the Psalms; and
for convenience they are designated: "the Wisdom
Literature." These writings deal chiefly with "wisdom,"
or the practical ordering of life, and we
frequently find a reference to "the words of the
wise," as if there was a school of teachers who were
devoted to the discussion of these problems. The
chief contributions of this school are, in our Bible,
the Book of Proverbs, and in the Apocrypha, Wisdom
and Ecclesiasticus. Job and Ecclesiastes are occupied
with the same problems, but their attitude is
critical and their method of treatment peculiar.</p>

<p>No one can fail to feel the almost perplexing
difference of this literature from the rest of the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Testament; unlike the prophetic it has less a message
to the conscience than a problem for the mind;
unlike the historical books it is perfectly timeless,
and utterly detached from the national hopes; it is
not occupied with ceremonies or ritual, but with
religion as a matter of conduct. The nearest
approach to this is to be found in some of the Psalms,
which, passing from the emotions of the devout spirit,
become engaged with the problems and injustices of
life. Its religion is more universal than that of the
Prophets or even of the Psalmists, but it is less
emotional; the religion of the heart has given way
to the wisdom of the mind. We have here the
beginnings of a philosophy, a mental activity strangely
absent from the Hebrew race; it is not however a
speculative philosophy, but one purely concerned
with practical life; and yet there is a direct progression
traceable from the chapters in Proverbs (i.-ix.),
which are devoted to the praise of wisdom, through
the work known as the Wisdom of Solomon, to
Philo, the great Jewish philosopher, who endeavoured
to interpret Moses by Plato and to reconcile Hebrew
religion with Greek speculation. Although in this
literature we have the beginnings of a philosophy it
is rather that of the street than of the academy; a
cultivation of a philosophic attitude towards life, its
problems and duties, rather than any speculation on
metaphysical reality or the absolute origin of things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
The wisdom we hear so much of is an intellectual
virtue, although it embraces neither speculation nor
learning, but is limited to mean sagacity, shrewdness,
prudence in the conduct of life. This is the
main theme of the Proverbs, but the problem of the
correct ordering of life unearths a deeper and darker
one&mdash;the problem of the existence of evil, the injustice
of life as revealed in the blind indiscrimination
of trouble, pain, and death. With this problem
some of the Psalms and the Books of Job and
Ecclesiastes especially deal.</p>

<p>In seeking to place this literature, we are met
with an even worse difficulty than in the case of
the Psalms; for the entire absence of historical
allusion, and the spirit of detachment in which
religious questions are discussed, leave no trace of
date or age. The three books in our Bible belonging
to this literature are ascribed to very early authors;
two to Solomon and one traditionally to Job or
Moses, although the Book of Job is really anonymous.
Now it is exceedingly difficult to gather from the
prophetic or historical books any trace of the
opinions that are found in the Wisdom Literature.
The problem of evil certainly began to occupy the
minds of men like Jeremiah even before the Exile;
but in the picture which the Prophets give us of the
Jewish state under the late monarchy, we get no
glimpse of a people who looked on life and religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
as do the writers of these books. In the Wisdom
Literature we find references to "the wise" as to a
special class in the community (Prov. i. 6; xxii. 17;
xxiv. 23; Job xv. 18); in the historical literature we
find the "wisdom" of certain men extolled (Solomon,
1 Kings iii. 16&ndash;28; iv. 29&ndash;34; x. 3 ff.; Joseph,
Gen. xli. 39; the four wise men, 1 Kings iv. 31, the
wisdom of Egypt, the East, 1 Kings iv. 30, and of
Edom, Ob. 8; Jer. xlix. 7), and in the prophetic
writings "the wise" are mentioned as a class distinct
from the prophet and the priest (Jer. xviii. 18) and
often in a depreciatory way (Isa. xxix. 14; Jer. viii. 8;
ix. 12). It seems almost impossible to identify the
wise men of Proverbs with this class who receive
so little praise from the Prophets. The wise men of
Proverbs do not speak as if they needed to defend themselves
against the claims of the prophet (Prov. xxix.
18; the reference to "vision," which can only mean
a communication to the prophet, is not found elsewhere
in Proverbs and is doubted by many scholars),
nor can we understand the need for the message of
the Prophets if this practical religion of "the wise"
was current in their times. This religion may lack
passion and be without national consciousness, but
Isaiah and Micah would surely have found something
to their heart's desire in its pure ethical character.
Indeed, the religious thought seems to be dependent
on the teaching of the Prophets, but only at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
distance, for it is ethically advanced and has
become somewhat rarefied and unemotional. The
literary character seems also to point to a later age;
for it is academical, sophistical, and polished. The
polish of the Proverbs might be due to constant use
among the common people, but they are not like
popular sayings (cp. 1 Sam, xxiv. 13; 1 Kings xx. 11;
Jer. xxxi. 29; Ezek. xviii. 2), and their evident kinship
with Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus indicates a late
post-exilic origin.</p>

<p>We shall first devote some time to an examination
of the Book of Proverbs. The Hebrew "proverb"
(<i>mashal</i>) means "a representation," and may be
used of a fable or a taunt, but is more especially
confined to any generalisation from experience or
observation on life and character expressed in a
rhythmic and polished form. The most usual form
of the proverb is a couplet in which a common fact
of Nature is placed beside a common fact of human
life: "Where there is no wood the fire goes out, and
where there is no talebearer strife will cease."</p>

<p>The book as a whole would seem to be ascribed
to Solomon (i. 1), but this is only the tradition of
the final editor; for, as in the case of the Psalter,
Proverbs shows every trace of gradual compilation,
and the names of other authors are given.</p>

<p>The main divisions of the book are as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. (i. 1&ndash;6). The prologue, by the final editor, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
ascribing the work to Solomon or else praising his
proverbs.</p>

<p>B. (i. 7&ndash;ix.). This seems to be the latest addition
to the book; it is not a collection of proverbs at all,
but is a continuous discourse in praise of Wisdom.
In viii. 22 Wisdom is personified as a creature of
God present at the creation of the world. This
hypostatization of an attribute of God is one of the
latest developments of Hebrew thought, and is so
unusual to its genius that we are compelled to
seek for some possibility of infiltration from foreign
sources. The idea is still further developed in
Ecclesiasticus (xxiv.), and in the Book of Wisdom
has become quite a Platonic speculation (vii. 22&ndash;viii.
1). The appearance of this idea in Hebrew
thought seems to be most explicable in the period
of Greek influence, when Plato's doctrine of the
Idea might become known in Palestine; somewhere
about 250 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> seems a likely date. The identification
of virtue with knowledge, which we find in the book,
is also due to Greek thought. It was along this line
of development that the conception of "the Logos"
was welcomed into Jewish thought, to have through
Philo such a profound influence on some of the
writers of the New Testament.</p>

<p>C. (x.-xxii. 16). This collection of proverbs is
ascribed to Solomon and is generally thought by critics
to be the oldest main collection; many would even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
be willing to assign it to the golden age of the
monarchy. The Solomonic authorship is, however,
unthinkable; the sentiments expressed are unsuitable
for a luxurious and polygamous monarch (xv. 16,
xxi. 31; xxii. 14; xiii. 1; cp. 1 Kings iv. 26; xi. 1, 4,
5&ndash;13; xii. 10, 11), and the ascription to Solomon
is probably due to circumstances similar to those
which operated in the case of the ascription of the
Psalms to David. There are many objections to any
pre-exilic time as a suitable historic background for
this collection; there is no mention of idolatry,
whereas we learn from Ezekiel (vi., viii., xxiii.) that
idolatry was practised in Jerusalem down to the time
of the city's destruction; monogamy seems to be
taken quite for granted, whereas it would appear
that polygamy was general before the prophetic
reforms; and of the great upheaval that these
reforms involved, this collection shows no trace.
The national religion has here given place to
universalism, a development that seems to demand
some experience of contact with other nations and
especially some acquaintance with foreign culture.
The references to the king neither require Solomonic
authorship nor demand an age when the monarchy
was established; for they are only general sentiments
concerning the duties of the king in the State, and are
of such a nature that they show very little reminiscence
of Israel's actual experience of a monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
D. (xxii. 17&ndash;xxiv. 22) and E. (xxiv. 23&ndash;34) are
two collections of the sayings of "the wise," whose
ascription, together with the reference to "instruction,"
points to an advanced stage of reflection and
teaching, and perhaps to the existence of philosophic
teachers who had schools and pupils.</p>

<p>F. (xxv.-xxix.). "These also are proverbs of
Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, King of Judah,
copied out." This title has an air of circumstantiality
about it which looks like a genuine historical note, and
it has been observed that there is a change of tone, in
this collection, in regard to the monarchy, as if some
actual experience of kingly tyranny had been lately
borne; so that if we were to refer this collection to
the age mentioned in the title we should have to
ante-date the collection, C. But in view of the
state of society here portrayed, which is similar to
that of Ecclesiasticus, we have no alternative but to
regard the title, as in the case of some of the Davidic
Psalms, as due to later Jewish scribes, and as
without authority.</p>

<p>G., H. and I. are three small collections (xxx.;
xxxi. 1&ndash;9; xxxi. 10&ndash;31), the first by Agur: a very
obscure passage, apparently quoting a declaration of
reverent agnosticism, with a reply to it by some
more believing scribe. The second is ascribed to
King Lemuel, and the third is in praise of a virtuous
woman, by an anonymous writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
The religious teaching of the Proverbs would seem
to be a refinement of the prophetic religion, standing
quite apart from the legal and ritual development.
Religion has become entirely a matter of ethics; the
creed is wonderfully colourless and simple, and the
inducement to virtue remains almost entirely on the
plane of utilitarianism and prudence. There is a
good deal that is quite worldly wisdom, but pure
religion is by no means wanting (xxi. 3; xiv. 34); the
fear of the Lord is not slavish fear, but is a guiding
principle for life and the beginning of wisdom. Men
are divided somewhat roughly into the foolish and
the wise; and although no book in the world has ever
depicted the foolishness of men with greater variety
and reality, yet there seems no hope that folly may
be overcome, or that wicked men can be turned from
their ways; Wisdom knows no forgiveness and can
only mock when men turn to her too late (i. 24&ndash;28).
Yet the ethical level is high; woman especially is
highly estimated, and the home life is held sacred;
kindness to animals is inculcated (xii. 10), and there
is a real approach to absolute ethics in such sayings
as: "Say not thou, I will recompense evil"; "Say
not I will do so to him as he hath done to me" (xx. 22;
xxiv. 17, 29; xxv. 21, 22). The writers have been
called "humanists," and this rightly describes their
position; it is the highest level rabbinical religion
ever reached; it has its parallel in some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
aphoristic teaching of Jesus, but it has no message
for the outcast and fallen; it knows no secret whereby
the fool may be made wise and the heart be changed
by a great emotion; it is the religion of the sage,
not the religion of the Saviour. The doctrine of
retribution is still thought to be quite satisfactory in
its working (ii. 21 f.; x. 25; xi. 21). In an earlier and
less reflective age this idea would not have been
unexpected; but it is remarkable that it should be
acquiesced in by the wise men; and yet it is an idea of
life that seems to persist against all experience: it is
found in the time of Christ and it still obtains,
especially in the judgment of the cause of poverty.
Perhaps its persistence is to be traced to an ideal of
justice so strong as to obscure accurate observation
of the facts.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When we turn to the Book of Job we come
to a work not only the greatest product of the
wise men, but the supreme literary production of
the Hebrew nation. The grandeur of its language
has somewhat obscured the real meaning of the
book; for the opinions that the book was written
to controvert are stated with such vivid power and
poetic grace that they are now often quoted as
Biblical truths of equal value with the opinions
apparently supported by the author. It is our task,
not so much to admire the literary talent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
author, as to estimate his contribution to the religion
of Israel.</p>

<p>The Book of Job has been referred to almost every
age from Moses to post-exilic times. There is
certainly an endeavour to reproduce the conditions
of the patriarchal age, in the avoidance of the name
Jehovah (Exod. vi. 3), and in the money standard
adopted (Job. xlii. 11); but there is no desire to
deceive the reader, for this archaic atmosphere is
adopted merely as the appropriate setting of the
dialogue, and is not maintained: the name Jehovah
slips from the author's pen, he takes no pains to
conceal his knowledge of the Law and his interest in
the questions of his own times. The question of age
is not to be complicated by the question of authorship;
there was a person named Job, known to
Ezekiel (xiv. 14), but there is nowhere any assumption
that Job himself wrote the book; and the mechanical
and symbolical character of the disasters which
befall Job, and the nature of the compensation, show
that we have here only dramatic settings for the
speeches and not actual history. It is likely that
there was a well-known tradition of a man named
Job who had suffered overwhelming troubles and
eventually had been restored to his former prosperity,
and this is made the basis for a discussion of the
problem of suffering. It has been suggested that in
the Prologue and Epilogue we have fragments of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
old tradition, since these passages are in prose while
the body of the book is in semi-poetic rhythm; but
the prose form is best explained as that always
adopted by the Hebrews for narrative, for we find
ideas in these parts that betray as late a date as
anything in the body of the work. Considered on
internal evidence, everything seems to point to the
age which produced the rest of the Wisdom Literature;
and more precisely, a date shortly before or
shortly after Proverbs, seems indicated. The material
for deciding more particularly is such that different
conclusions may be drawn from it. For instance,
the personification of wisdom in Proverbs seems to
be in advance of the idea of wisdom in Job; and if
we could think of the development of an idea always
coinciding with chronological progression, then Job
would need to be placed earlier than Proverbs; but
this is complicated by the fact that the main body of
the book of the Proverbs may have been in circulation
before the earlier chapters were added. Yet there
are apparent quotations from the Proverbs in the
Book of Job (xv. 7 f. = Prov. viii. 22&ndash;25), and the
reference to the lamp of the wicked being put out
(Prov. xiii. 9; xxiv. 20) seems clearly to have Proverbs
in mind (Job. xxi. 17). Dependence might, of
course, be taken to lie the other way, but on the
whole, it would appear that the problems dealt with
in Job have not yet emerged for the writers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Proverbs, and indeed Job seems rather an indictment
of the superficial idea, which we find everywhere
assumed in the earlier work that prosperity and
goodness are inseparable. The most satisfactory
order seems therefore to be: Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes.
The idea that Job is to be understood as a
personification of the nation, such as we were led to
conceive in the allegory of Jonah and in the Servant
of the Lord, can hardly be maintained in face of the
perfect detachment from the history and the national
hopes that characterises the book.</p>

<p>The book deals with a problem already stirring in
the minds of the Prophets and the theme of many of
the Psalms, but here stated with an awful daring and
intensity and as the subject-matter of an entirely new
form of literary composition. The Book of Job is
not a drama, in the sense that it was ever intended,
or would be suitable, for presentation on the stage;
but it is a poem with dramatic elements and it has a
dramatic movement.</p>

<p>The endeavour to understand the message of the
book is rendered difficult because different points of
view are presented, and this has suggested different
authors. The book certainly has well-marked
divisions, and they appear to yield distinct and
different solutions of the problem of suffering. The
Prologue shows us what has taken place in heaven,
and seems to infer that the trials came upon Job to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
establish his faith and righteousness; but the
speeches between Job and his friends, in the second
division, if by the same author as the Prologue,
skilfully avoid this explanation, and the drama
pursues its course with the actors remaining in complete
ignorance of the solution that has been disclosed
to the audience. The third division is taken up with
the speeches of Elihu: these break the continuity of
the poem, Job makes no reply to him, and Elihu is
not mentioned in the Epilogue. An examination of
these speeches shows that they fall somewhat below
the level of brilliance and originality maintained in
the rest of the book, and the idea that they proceed
from another writer of the same school, who felt that
the arguments of the three friends had not been presented
in the best possible way, is worthy of consideration.
The speeches of Jehovah are by the
author of the main portion and are wonderfully
impressive and grand, although the exact contribution
that they make to the discussion of the problem
is difficult to discern. The Epilogue falls back into
prose, and was certainly written by one who had the
entire work before him; but it so misses the meaning
of the whole argument, and is content with such a
superficial solution of restoration, that it has been
thought by many to be an addition to the original
work. Whatever may be thought of the idea of
plural authorship as a solution of these divergences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
the divergences themselves must be borne in mind in
any attempt to estimate the message of the book.
But are these different points of view incompatible
with a single author? With an author of such
extraordinary talent in voicing opinions with which
he evidently does not agree, it cannot be said to be
impossible; and it may be that he only wished to
state the problem and to give those answers which
were current in his age, leaving it to the reader to
discover whether these answers were really solutions;
the Prologue and Epilogue may have nothing to do
with the didactive motive, but only be due to dramatic
and artistic demands.</p>

<p>The theology of Job certainly demands a late age
and an advanced stage of reflection. One interesting
point is raised by the employment, in the Prologue,
of the figure of Satan. This personality, so fruitful
a factor in speculation on the cause of evil, demands
a careful study. It should be noted, first, that he is
referred to as <i>the</i> Satan, that is, "the Adversary";
it is a generic, not a proper, name. This creature is
represented as appearing together with the angels in
the presence of God, and although his designs are
sinister and his suggestions unworthy, he is still a
minister doing the will of God. This delegation of
evil advocacy can be traced, from the idea that it is
due to God Himself (2 Sam. xxiv. 1), to the work
of the separate spirit who offered to entice Ahab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
(1 Kings xxii. 21), and then to the greater definiteness
of our author. Beyond this book, again, the adversary
is a darker character who has to be rebuked by
God (Zech. iii.), and in the history of the Chronicler
<i>the</i> Satan has become "Satan," a proper name
(1 Chron. xxi. 1; cp. 2 Sam. xxiv. 1); but we have to
go outside the Old Testament Canon to get a completely
dualistic opposition of God and Satan
(Wisdom ii. 24).</p>

<p>The conception of God has passed, in this book,
entirely beyond the tribal Deity Jehovah, and even
beyond the ethical Personality known to the Prophets,
to One who is felt to be unknowable; and yet withal
Job clings to the idea that he shall one day see the
face of the Redeemer who now hides Himself. As in
the Psalms, the alleged idea of immortality (xix. 25 ff.)
is not very definite, and so contradicts the general
expectation of the book (vii. 9 f. x. 21 f. xiv. 10 ff. 20 ff.
xvi. 22; xxi. 26; xxx. 23), that it must be taken to
refer to Job's conviction that some vindication of his
cause will be made here in this life. At the same
time the idea of a future judgment which shall proclaim
his innocence and the ill-desert of his sufferings,
is so strong, that it sweeps death out of vision,
and the hope of the future life hovers in the thought
if it does not break into language.</p>

<p>A dispassionate examination of the solutions here
offered to the problem of suffering shows that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
really beyond a negative position is reached in this
book. The speeches of Job must be taken to convey
the author's opinions, and they are a most emphatic
repudiation of the doctrine of Providence expressed
by the three friends. They can only repeat the
accepted notion that suffering is everywhere the cause
of sin, and with scorn and indignation Job repudiates
the charge, so far as he is concerned; he maintains
his innocence and appeals to God as his witness;
but the Witness is silent and there is no daysman
betwixt them. Job's protest is not concerned with
mere innocence, for in one magnificent passage he
appeals to his beneficent life spent in the service of
the poor and needy (xxxi.). The answers of Job
leave the little system of Providence supported by
his friends, completely discredited, and in this
particular Jehovah sides with Job. The theophany
and speeches of Jehovah do not, however, seem to
convey any further contribution to the problem than
perhaps the idea that for man it is insoluble, because
he does not and cannot see the whole; and so nothing
is left for man but to bear his griefs in silence and
maintain his trust in God.</p>

<p>Job remains, not only the finest contribution of
Semitic genius to the realm of literature, but a classic
for all those who feel the anguish of the world and
the unintelligible perplexities of life. If it conveys
no real solution, it at least disposes of one long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
accepted as adequate, and its complete overthrow
removes one of the worst mistakes of human observation
and refutes one of the cruellest judgments of men.
The idea that prosperity always follows goodness
has been a most disastrous bequest of Hebrew thought,
and has more than anything else obscured from men's
eyes the real meaning of life, prevented an accurate
judgment of character, and done much to turn aside
the expression of sympathy and obscure the duty of
pity and forgiveness.</p>

<p>That a solution was not within the limits of Israel's
faith cannot be affirmed with Isa. liii. before us;
but that it had never been rightly understood and
had never taken deep hold of even noble minds is
driven home with a telling force, in a further contribution
of the Wisdom Literature, the Book of
Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>The name Ecclesiastes is borrowed from the
attempt to translate the Hebrew term <i>Qoheleth</i> into
Greek. Of this name a variety of interpretations
have been put forward (Qoheleth, from <i>qahal</i> an
assembly, is the active feminine participle and means,
one who calls, or addresses, or is merely member
of, an assembly; A.V., "the Preacher"; R.V. "the
great Orator"), but the one that perhaps best
describes the term is that of "the debater." The
work is put forward in the name of Solomon, and of
all the works ascribed to him there is none that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
would come so suitably from the pen of that
monarch, if he ever reflected deeply on his career;
but this ascription is not kept up with any idea of
deceiving the reader, but is simply one of the literary
customs of the time and a way of honouring a great
name, for there are biographical statements impossible
to Solomon ("I <i>was</i> king," i. 12; "above
all that were before me in Jerusalem," i. 16), while
the reflection of society and the stage of thought,
but most notably the extremely late language, betray
what is one of the latest of the Old Testament
writings.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastes is a work that has held an unusual
fascination for certain types of disposition, Renan
declaring that it was the only lovely thing that ever
came from a Hebrew mind. The presence of the
book at all in the Old Testament is strange, and
there were strong opinions against admitting it into
the Canon; it was perhaps only eventually sanctioned
because its contradictory statements made it possible
to interpret the book as a work written to controvert
pessimistic ideas, which are brought forward only to
be refuted. For the intention of the work is difficult
to gather owing to its disjointed and incomplete
character, which makes the book as it stands a
mass of contradictions. Some passages profess utter
pessimism and unbelief in God's providence, while
others, like the closing chapter, seek to inculcate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
religious fear and trust. Various theories have been
proposed to explain these phenomena occurring in
one book. It has been suggested that the work is
a dialogue between a doubting scholar and an
orthodox believer. With a view of straightening
out the argument it has been conjectured that the
sheets of the original have somehow become disarranged,
and others have thought of a series of
interpolations in an originally quite unbelieving
work; first by a writer who wishes to defend
Wisdom from the author's charges of unprofitableness,
and then by a writer who wishes to defend the
providence of God. If interpolation is to be thought
of at all&mdash;and it should only be a refuge of despair&mdash;it
is to be sought in the opening and closing verses
of the last chapter (xii. 1, 13, 14), which may have
been added to correct the influence of the work;
but even they are not impossible from this strangely
vacillating author. Certainly no explanations can
remove the gloomy tone of the book. The writer
seems to have come into contact with Greek
pessimism, and from this standpoint he sees nothing
true in the Hebrew doctrine of retribution, and
especially does he reject the too optimistic doctrines
of the Wisdom school. The problems that are solved
so simply in Proverbs, stated and left unanswered
by Job, are by this author answered in entirely
negative fashion: nothing is profitable in this life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
nothing is new; nature and man move in an endless
cycle without hope or meaning. The pursuit of
Wisdom is just as foolish as the pursuit of folly:
the end of the fool and the end of the wicked is the
same; life is not worth living; vanity of vanities, all
is vanity. In this book we at last come upon a
clear recognition of the doctrine of immortality, but
only to find it explicitly denied by our author
(iii. 19&ndash;21). The only solution that the writer
proposes is a sad Epicureanism: make the best
of a bad world. And yet in spite of this conclusion
the author still believes in God (iii. 11, 14; viii. 17);
but He is a God who has hidden His purpose from
man and whom man can do nothing to turn from
His ways. This is more like the inscrutable Fate
of the Greek tragedians than the Jehovah of the
Prophets: indeed the word Jehovah is never once
used throughout the book. If the concluding
chapter comes from the original author, then it
recommends a religious attitude towards these
mysteries; but there is no revelation of anything
that gives assurance of the reasonableness of this
position or of the goodness of God.</p>

<p>What are we to learn from this Book? Are we
to refuse to read it and to reverse the judgment that
included it in the Canon? Hardly that. It is well
that man's doubts should find a place in the same
sacred collection with his surest beliefs, for doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
may be but a stage in a process from an inadequate
to a fuller faith. The book shows that the common
appreciation of Israel's faith could not satisfy the
mind that had its attention fixed upon the facts of
life; and especially does it show that the hope of
immortality, apart from which Israel's faith had
largely developed, is not the one thing that is
lacking. That hope, with its promise of retribution
in a future and better world, will always appear too
speculative to some minds to relieve the burdens of
the life that now is, and even if believed in, it would
offer no real clue to the meaning of our trials here,
but only tend to take men's eyes off this life where
perchance they might find the solution they have
missed. For there is an attitude to life that solves
its darkest problems, a disposition which transmutes
its pain and failure, finding it no enigma, but an
opportunity for learning the will of the Father; our
presence here not a thing to be reluctantly borne,
but a task to be joyfully accepted as the commission
of God. The book of Ecclesiastes shows us, therefore,
that the revelation through Israel is not yet
complete; for it voices the unsatisfied need and
stretches out hands of faith for something not yet
made known. It is the deep dark of the night; the
next hour will see the Morning Star of Bethlehem
above the horizon, the fleeing shadows and the
breaking of the day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The prevalence of the expectation of a personal Messiah reflected in
the Gospels, and the clearness and consistency of the idea, are not to be
explained solely from the Old Testament prophecies.</p>

<p>In the Apocrypha the Messianic expectation has almost died out
(Ecclus. xlix. 11; 1 Macc. ii. 57), but after the Maccabæan revolt it
revived, owing doubtless to the disappointment caused by the deterioration
of the Hasmonæan dynasty, of which so much had been expected.
The Pharisees, who resented the policy of the Hasmonæans, made the
idea of a restoration of the Davidic line the peculiar property of their
party, and from this time until the appearance of Jesus, Messianic
expectation reached a point never before attained. The following
summary shows the emergence of the idea in the literature of the
<span class="locked">period:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The Dream-Visions of Enoch. <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 166&ndash;161. The Messiah
appears under the figure of a white bullock, and the saints are changed
into His image. The Messiah has only an official function in the world-drama,
and a human though glorified personality.</p>

<p>(2) The Sibylline Oracles. In a passage assigned to <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 140, the
Messiah is represented as a God-sent King, who is expected to arise
from the East, and whose appearance will be a signal for an attack upon
the Temple by the Gentiles.</p>

<p>(3) The Book of Jubilees. <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 135&ndash;105. The writer is concerned
more with the Messianic Kingdom, which he conceives of spiritually,
than with the Messiah, who is only alluded to once, and who is expected
to arise from Judah.</p>

<p>(4) The Similitudes of Enoch. <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 95&ndash;80. This part of the Book
of Enoch is much occupied with the person of the Messiah. He is
definitely named "the Messiah," and also bears the titles "the Elect
One," "the Righteous One," and "the Son of Man." He is a Prophet
and a Teacher, "the light of the Gentiles," all judgment is committed
unto Him, and He will sit on the throne of His glory. He will raise
again to life all the righteous who have died.</p>

<p>(5) The Psalms of Solomon. <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 70&ndash;40. The Messiah is to be
sinless; He is the Son of David; He will not adopt the ordinary methods
of warfare, but will smite the earth with the rod of His mouth.</p>

<p>The following works all belong to the Christian era, but they may
reflect ideas that had an earlier <span class="locked">origin:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(6) The Assumption of Moses. <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 7&ndash;30. The hope of an earthly
Messiah is abandoned and it is God Himself who is expected to take
vengeance on His enemies.</p>

<p>(7) The Apocalypse of Baruch. <i>c.</i> 70 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> The Messiah will appear
after Israel's enemies have been destroyed. His Kingdom is likened to
"the bright lightning," and at the end of His reign He is to return in
glory to heaven.</p>

<p>(8) 2 Esdras. <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 81&ndash;96. The Messiah, although more than
earthly, dies after a reign of 400 years. He is pictured as a lion
rebuking an eagle (the Roman power), and "as it were with the likeness
of a man" arising from the midst of the sea, and flying with the clouds
of heaven.</p>

<span class="subhead">MESSIANIC EXPECTATIONS</span></h3>

<p>In all the stages through which the Old Testament
religion passed there seems to have existed a consciousness
of their imperfection, and this produced a
tendency to gaze into the future, in which it was
thought the ideal religion would exist, and where
could be descried the perfect realisation of God's
dwelling among men. It is natural that this characteristic
should find its clearest expression in the
Prophets. When their eyes are upon the present,
they condemn; when they look to the immediate
future, they utter grave warning and the shadows
deepen upon their faces; but when they lift their
eyes to the distant hills of time, the light is on their
faces, and they break into songs of the days that are
yet to be. It is this vision of the future and the
endeavour to give it a definite outline that runs like
a thread through the Old Testament and forces us
to look beyond its borders for the ultimate issue of
its religious development. This subject may best
be studied under the general head of Messianic
expectations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
The immediate difficulty in understanding this
subject is found in the circumstance that it has
received from Bible students an exaggerated attention,
and has been pursued with methods that the
best modern scholarship cannot sanction. The
eager hunting for Messianic prophecy, and the
desire to find literal fulfilment, has often stretched
the meaning of passages unwarrantably and made a
sane exegesis appear tame and uninteresting. But
more disastrous has been the effect upon the understanding
of the Old Testament as a whole. The
literature has been treated as a mysterious typology,
in which some indirect picture of the Messiah was to
be discovered, or a series of exact predictions of His
life and work. This has destroyed the sense of perspective,
it has ignored the message of the Prophets
to their own age, and it has been responsible for the
idea that the religion of the Psalmists was simply a
pious expectation of the Messiah, instead of a real
communion with God.</p>

<p>It is difficult to gain a right appreciation of this
subject after it has suffered such abuse, but a serious
effort should be made; for it is in the understanding
of the Messianic expectation that we shall find a key
to the New Testament and more especially to that
conflict of soul which the acceptance of the Messiahship
seems to have brought upon Jesus.</p>

<p>The method of study followed will be an endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
to read all alleged Messianic predictions, first of all
in the light of their actual meaning for the age in
which they were uttered; but more particularly it
will embrace the general ideas of the future of which
the conception of the Messiah forms only a part.
We shall find that the conscious prediction of
the Messiah is somewhat reduced in bulk, and that
the Messianic expectation includes something more
than a figure of the Messiah himself, and is indeed
sometimes found without any such feature.</p>

<p>The Messianic ideal involves the whole conception
of the religious future of Israel. The Hebrew religion
receives much inspiration from its tradition of the
past, but infinitely more from its hopes for the future:
the golden age is not thought to lie far back in history,
but in a time yet to come. It seems likely that
this idea was widely dispersed even among the
common people, and it is therefore only natural that it
should often have been held in an unspiritual manner
and expressed after a material fashion. This hope
was seized upon by the Prophets, and by them
elevated above a merely material expectation; they
enriched it by the wealth of their creative genius, and
from their time it receives a definite content. Standing
far above their contemporaries in their conception
of the meaning of Jehovah's covenant with
Israel, the Prophets were forced to realise the failure
of their message to win immediate acceptance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
sometimes they witnessed its entire rejection by the
people; and therefore it was inevitable that they
should look to the future to yield what the present
seemed unable to produce: a religion pure, simple,
and free from all limitations. If we inquire the
reason of this hope, we find it in their trust in
Jehovah's covenant and in their conviction of the
ultimate triumph of truth. Now it was not unnatural,
with the peculiar character of their national history,
for their hopes to group themselves around some
commanding figure; for all along Israel had been
moved by splendid personalities. They were accustomed
to the appearance of men whose power and
genius marked them out as fitted by Jehovah for
some mighty task; so that whenever they think of
the future and come to a detailed description of their
vision they descry one dominant figure, the symbol
and representative of the people, but also the symbol
and representative of the power of Jehovah dwelling
among them. This figure receives his peculiar
outline largely from the needs of their immediate
times, and any person of whom great things are
expected may be hailed as the Messiah (Cyrus,
Isa. xlv. 1; Haggai ii. 20&ndash;23, seems to suggest that
Zerubbabel is the expected Messiah; and Zech.
vi. 12 uses Messianic language of Joshua the High
Priest).</p>

<p>We should have expected that the figure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Messiah, as conceived by the Prophets, would partake
largely of the prophetic office idealised and
accepted by an obedient people. This however is
not the case. There is a promise of a prophet made
through Moses, which in the New Testament has
been interpreted as a Messianic prophecy (Deut.
xviii. 18; Acts iii. 22, vii. 37), but an examination of
the passage, which follows a denunciation of the
practices of divination, necromancy, and sorcery, out
of which primitive Prophetism arose, shows that it is
a promise of the establishment of the prophetic office
rather than of any one person. Elsewhere Moses is
made to exclaim: "would that all the Lord's people
were prophets" (Num. xi. 29). Both these passages
are due to prophetic teaching, and this is the Prophets'
conception of their office: they do not rejoice in
their splendid isolation and their unique relation to
God; they are grieved that the people do not share
their possession of the Spirit of God and their hearing
of His word, for to them these things are the essence
of all true religion. So they look forward to a time
when their office will no longer be necessary (Jer. xxxi.
34), and when the Spirit of the Lord shall be poured
out on all flesh (Joel ii. 28f). It is not in any contradiction
to this that the picture of the Servant of the
Lord, delineated by the Second Isaiah, is largely drawn
from the prophetic office (Isa. xlii. 1&ndash;4, xlix. 1&ndash;6,
l. 4); for the Servant is the Nation of Israel fulfilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
her prophetic role among the nations of mankind.
In the late prophecy of Malachi the figure of Elijah
the prophet is seen in the future, but only as the
herald of the coming of the Messianic era (Mal. iv. 5).</p>

<p>The Priest contributes little more than the Prophet
to the picture (Zech. iii.; vi. 12; Psa. cx.); for
to the prophetic conception of things the Priesthood is
hardly a necessary office in a true religion. It is
from the office of the King that the Messiah is
largely drawn. This conception could only have
arisen after the founding of the monarchy and
only when the real David had faded far enough
into the past to be idealised. It was in their experience
of the imperfection of the Kings of Israel and
Judah that the Prophets saw the need for a true
kingly head; and in the oppression of military
kingdoms, the need for a mighty warrior. And yet
it is not a king who fills the picture of the future,
so much as a kingdom.</p>

<p>Outside the Prophets and the Psalms we find little
expectation of a personal Messiah, but we find almost
everywhere the conception of an ideal or Messianic
age. What has been called the Protevangelium,
the promise to the woman that her seed should bruise
the serpent's head (Gen. iii. 15), does not point
explicitly to any one person, but simply promises
that in man's eternal warfare with temptation he
shall at length gain the victory. The prophecy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Balaam (Num. xxiv. 17&ndash;19) involves nothing more
than the future supremacy of Israel. Jacob's blessing
on Judah (Gen. xlix. 10) promises a stable
dynasty to that tribe, and the reference to Shiloh is
so obscure that nothing can be built upon it (<i>Shiloh</i>
may mean peace, but in the Septuagint the phrase is
translated: "until that which is his shall come."
Another ancient reading is: "till he come whose it
is." Shiloh might refer to the town of that name,
but this would give no help to the interpretation.
The text must be corrupt).</p>

<p>It will be necessary for us to examine the circle of
ideas which form the background of the Messianic
hope and from which the idea of the Messiah emerges.
When the Prophets speak of the future they often use
a strange phrase: "the day of the Lord." This is found
first in Amos (v. 18), but its occurrence there shows
that it was already a term in use among the people,
for Amos had to dissent from the popular idea of its
character. The term comes from the Hebrew idiom
of the "day" of battle, and it comes to be used of the
great conflict in which Jehovah will entirely overthrow
the enemies of Israel; it is therefore looked for with
expectant hope. Amos points out that the manifestation
of Jehovah will be fatal to sin, whether in Israel
or in other nations: <i>dies iræ, dies illa</i>. Thus modified
by Amos this is the conception which, with varying
details, becomes the prophetic idea of the Day of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Lord. It may therefore come in some threatened
invasion; later, it is conceived as a gathering of all the
nations against Jerusalem, from which we get the
picture of Armageddon, the last great war before the
establishment of peace; and finally it becomes the
world assize, and so the "day" of judgment of the
New Testament. This "day" is to separate
the history of God's dealings with men into two
distinct periods, and will be the dividing line between
the perfect and the imperfect; so that all the bright
visions of the future are to be "after those days."
The Prophets believe that reconstruction can only
come after destruction, that history will reach its
ideal over a precipice; they believe in a reform by
cataclysm rather than by evolution. Every threatening
of political change or national disaster may
herald the coming of that day; it is always at hand; to
their vision, they are living near the finality of things.
There is a great deal in this imagery that fails to
appeal to modern ideas of history and progress. It
was part of the prophetic scheme and as such was a
limitation of perfect vision; but shorn of its mere
form it remains a witness to their consciousness of the
activity of God in human history and of His judgment
in the crises of the world. The form was a
limitation essential to their stage of mental evolution
and to its intelligibility to their age; its spirit is an
eternal message to mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Immediately after the Day of the Lord, the
Messianic Age is ushered in, and in depicting the
conditions of that time the lyrical genius of the
Prophets reaches its supreme expression, and these
passages still inspire the reformer and move men
with their ideals of peace. The picture of that age is
composed by projecting into the future their own
institutions and especially their religious conceptions.
They picture a condition of human society which is
best described in the phrase, "the kingdom of God";
for although such an expression never breaks forth
from their lips, its contents are obviously in their
minds. It is to be a community in which the will of
God is perfectly realised, when religion shall no
longer consist in statutes and commands, but in the
recognition of an inner law. Absolute righteousness,
individual and civil, will prevail, and the nations
shall learn war no more. The animal and natural
creation will share in this beneficent order: the lion
shall lie down with the lamb, and the wilderness
shall blossom like the rose; the veil shall be torn
from men's vision, all tears shall be wiped away, and
death shall be swallowed up in victory.</p>

<p>When they come to depict the subjects of this
kingdom they fail to attain to the inner and ethical
requirements enunciated by Jesus, for national hopes
and ambitions still cloud their outlook. There are two
streams of thought&mdash;one frankly particularistic, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the future of the heathen is ignored, or where they
are simply to be exterminated; and the other universalistic,
where the conversion of the whole world is
expected (Isa. xlv. 22; Jer. xii. 14 ff, xvi. 19; cp.
Isa. xi. 14&ndash;16 with xix. 18&ndash;25). It is somewhat
surprising, in view of the subsequent development
of these ideas under Christian thought, that the
sphere of this tremendous change is conceived to be
this present earth; and even when the necessity of a
new earth and a new heaven is considered, it is
still earth that is to be the chief theatre of events.
Heaven is conceived of as the dwelling place of
Jehovah, but there is no idea that this great change
is to be postponed or relegated to some heavenly
condition; heaven is to come down to earth and
Jehovah is to dwell among His people and be
their God.</p>

<p>It is from the ground of these ideas that there
arises the conception of the person known as the
Messiah, who shall be the Divine instrument in
bringing about this blessed condition. Messiah is
from the Hebrew, <i>Mashiah</i>, and means "anointed
one." The actual phrase, <i>the</i> Messiah, without
further qualification, is not found in the Old Testament
(Dan. ix. 25, A.V. "The Messiah" is incorrect;
it should read: "an anointed one, a prince," as R.V.
mar.); but after the closing of the Canon the phrase
was constantly used to denote the Jewish hope of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
appearance of a singular person, of Davidic descent,
who should be superhumanly endowed, and who
should overturn the enemies of the Jews and place
their nation at the head of the world. The title
recalls the mode of consecration used for priests and
kings by anointing them with oil (Lev. iv. 3, 5, 16;
vi. 22; 1 Sam. ii. 35; xii. 3), and "the anointed of
Jehovah" is the common title for the kings of Israel.
The origin of this idea of the Messianic King
may certainly be traced to Nathan's promise to
David of a perpetual seed which should occupy his
throne and be the special delight and care of Jehovah
(2 Sam. vii. 2&ndash;17). In the presence of a weak or
unworthy occupant of the throne this promise would
come to mind, and would gather new meaning as the
Prophets saw in the troubles of their times the
imminence of the Day of the Lord. It is to the
prophet Isaiah that we owe a striking conception
of a monarch who not only fulfils his promise but
transcends it in a way that is hardly conceivable in a
merely human king. The first emergence of this
hope in the mind of the prophet occurs when he
attempts to restrain Ahaz from joining the fatal
confederacy of Syria and Ephraim against Assyria.
When Ahaz demands some confirmation, the prophet
promises the sign of a young woman who shall bear
a child named Immanuel (Isa. vii. 14&ndash;17). Following
Matthew, Christian expositors have taken this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
to be a prophecy of the virgin birth of Jesus;
although it is difficult to see how this could be a
sign to Ahaz. The subject is obscure to the last
degree. The Hebrew word rendered "a virgin,"
although capable of such a special application, means
simply a young woman. The translation "virgin"
was first made by the Septuagint, and this may point
to the fact that at the time this version was made the
Messiah was expected to be born of a virgin. The
prophecy seems to have arisen from the conviction
that the Assyrian invasion would bring into existence
some person who should represent the active presence
of God with His people; and beyond this explanation
there is nothing but mere speculation. But in a
later oracle of Isaiah's (ix. 6f), the conception has
grown in definiteness, and this expected person is
crowned with such honorific titles as "Wonder of a
Counsellor, Hero-God, Father of Eternity, Prince of
Peace." To our ears these titles convey the sense of
absolute Divinity, but it is questionable whether they
meant that to Isaiah. Eastern monarchs have
always been addressed with high-sounding titles, and
Isaiah's language may have been coloured by foreign
court customs; but still it would remain that the
titles lead us to expect an unexampled figure who
possesses attributes that mark him out as specially
equipped by God. Once more Isaiah returns to this
figure (xi. 1&ndash;12), and now definitely asserts that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
shall spring from David's line; only now the majesty
of his person is conceived as due to his seven-fold
possession of the Spirit of Jehovah, and his character
fits him rather for administrative and prophetic
work. Micah, a contemporary of Isaiah, has much
the same figure (v. 2&ndash;5) of a mighty prince of Davidic
lineage and of mysterious birth (Bethlehem simply
stands here for David's line, and "whose outgoings
have been from eternity" probably means nothing
more than that his descent shall spring from this
ancient ancestor). There is an inexplicable element
in these predictions, but they have been found elsewhere,
outside Israel, in times of great national
danger or expectation. In Israel, the idealisation of
David, the personal element in her history, and the
increased possibilities discovered in human personality
when under the complete dominion of the Spirit of
Jehovah, have contributed to the creation of this
figure. It cannot be said that it was a mental vision
of the person of Jesus that shaped the prophecy,
for it must not be forgotten that it was an immediate
fulfilment that they expected; and indeed their
picture so utterly misled the Jews, that, when Christ
claimed to be the Messiah, they treated His claim as
blasphemous. While we can see that Christ was
indeed a King, it is only by a spiritual conception of
kingship, and only after the verdict of history has
crowned Him as a true ruler of men; not by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
actual resemblance to the external magnificence of
the Messianic King. When the Messianic call came
to Jesus He found in these passages a difficulty, for
they outlined a programme He could only reject; but
it was other and indirect allusions of the old Testament,
some of which had never been considered as
Messianic, that Jesus took for His pattern. This
meant a reading of prophecy very different from that
of the Jews of His time, and it is surely here that
the views we have found ourselves forced to accept
in regard to Old Testament prophecy can claim
the support of Jesus Himself. It is important to
grasp this point: the argument from predictions
definitely fulfilled in Jesus has failed to convince the
Jews, who ought to understand their own Scriptures
best, and we must recognise that it is only a spiritual
interpretation of prophecy and a valuation of Jesus
which owes nothing to flesh and blood that can see
in Him One of whom all the Prophets bore witness.</p>

<p>It is to these other conceptions, to which the
spiritual intuition of Jesus led Him in His search for
support for His Messianic ideals, that we must now
turn.</p>

<p>The first of these in importance is undoubtedly
"the Servant of the Lord." We saw when examining
this idea that it was an ideal of a nation rather
than of an individual, and yet it was upon this that
Jesus fixed, and it was this idea that seemed to mould<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
His whole conception of His mission. According to
Luke, the first discourse of Jesus took place in the
Synagogue at Nazareth, where He set forth His programme
and policy, and stated them to be identical
with those the prophet had outlined for the nation
centuries before (Luke iv. 16&ndash;21; Isa. lxi. 1, 2); and
the evangelist Matthew sees in the methods of
Jesus a fulfilment of the prophecy of the Servant
(Matt. xii. 18&ndash;21; Isa. xlii. 1&ndash;4). It was probably
as Jesus saw the clouds gather about His life and
disaster began to threaten that He was led to study
the career of that Servant and see that it involved
suffering, being despised and rejected of men; and
so He came to find the key to the mystery of His
Cross in that classic of the vicarious life, the
fifty-third chapter of Isaiah. Jesus was probably
the first to interpret that passage in a Messianic
sense.</p>

<p>His reason for adopting the title of "the Son of
Man" is exceedingly difficult to trace; it may be said
that no completely satisfactory explanation of the
origin or meaning of the term has yet been discovered,
and in the present state of research on the subject it
would be folly to commit ourselves to any of the
theories that have been propounded. We can only
keep in mind the various facts, which the use of this
title in the Gospels presents to us. It is clear that
Jesus did not intend the title to be a declaration to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the world that He had accepted the Messianic call;
for all along it was His deliberate purpose to conceal
His Messiahship, and for reasons that are obvious,
when we consider the difference between His conception
of Messianic function and that of the Jews of
His day. Again, although there is a slight difference
between Daniel, where we only hear of "one like
unto a son of man," and Jesus who calls Himself
"<i>the</i> son of man," yet when challenged by the high-priest
Jesus certainly quotes from Daniel (Dan. vii.
13; Mark xiv. 62). Now in Daniel it is not a person
who is figured by this title, so much as a humane
kingdom which is to replace the kingdoms that were
more like beasts in their character. It is only in the
Book of Enoch that the Son of Man is definitely
identified with the Messiah. Did Jesus ever read
that Book, or were its ideas at all commonly known?
If so we should have to concede that the Son of
Man meant the Messiah, both to Jesus and to the
people, and yet this is an apparent contradiction of
His general motive in keeping the Messiahship secret.</p>

<p>Perhaps, and the suggestion is made with the
knowledge that in the present state of the problem
it can be nothing more than a suggestion, there is a
line that has not been exhausted, and along which
help may yet be found. It starts from the fact that
Jesus seems to have adopted the <i>character</i> of the
Servant of the Lord under the <i>name</i> of the Son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Man; and we have seen that both these are ideals of
a community or a nation rather than of a person.
Again, that somehow the title "the Son of Man"
had Messianic significance, and in the mind of Jesus
was connected with the figure in Daniel, is seen from
His confession before Caiaphas. The contradiction
between these facts and the purpose of concealing
His Messiahship can perhaps be solved by noticing
that Jesus never explicitly identifies Himself with
the Son of Man; and if all the passages where this
title is found in the Synoptics are examined, they
seem to separate themselves into three distinct
groups: (1) where the reference might be not only
to Jesus Himself but to Man fulfilling his ideal;
(2) where the reference is to the suffering which the
Son of Man must undergo; (3) and most important,
this term is always used when Jesus speaks of that
mysterious return on the clouds which is known as
the Second Advent. The conclusion to which it is
suggested all these facts point is that although Jesus
believed Himself to be the personal centre on which
the Messianic hope converged, it was not to Himself
personally, but to the new humanity which His
Spirit should beget, that He looked for the complete
fulfilment of the Messianic hope. Thus at least are
linked together the fact that the Prophets are occupied
rather with the Messianic community than with
the Messiah, and the fact that Jesus made the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and aim of His teaching the Kingdom rather than
its personal embodiment in Himself. Jesus certainly
read these Prophets more according to their real
inwardness than any of His contemporaries or than
many generations of Christian scholars; and there is
no better preparation for the serious study of the
Gospels than a careful examination of the growing
revelation of the Old Testament religion, and the
inner meaning of the Messianic hope.</p>

<p>Of this wonderful growth and moving revelation,
it can be said, in a way deeper than the old typological
and prophetic methods of study could understand,
that Christ is the aim and the goal; not only
Jesus of Nazareth with His unique Personality, but
that still more transcendent mystery, the Christ
within the heart, Christ the head of every man. If
we have learned nothing else, surely we have learned
this: that behind the hopes of mankind, behind their
misty dreams, their gropings after truth, their struggles
for righteousness, are the eternal thoughts of God;
and although these may transcend their poor reflection
in the mind of man, as the heavens the earth,
yet this remains: that for every hope implanted,
there is an answer beyond our expectation; for every
desire Godward, the revelation of the Father-friend;
for every ideal of the human heart, the Christ; and
for every effort after human progress, the ever nearer
coming of the Kingdom of God.</p>
